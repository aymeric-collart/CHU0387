```

This course introduces the principles of corpus studies assisted by modern technology with an emphasis on hands-on practice, and how corpus data can be useful in understanding how language is used in the media or in the literature. The course is divided into three parts: (a) fundamental concepts and practices when working with a corpus, (b) the process of building a corpus from texts on the Internet with modern technology, and (c) the handling, analyses and visualization of the corpus data. By the end of the course, the students are expected to acquire the basic knowledge of working with a corpus and will obtain a first approach to programming languages.
