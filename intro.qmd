# Structure of the course

## What are the steps of a corpus study?

The workflow of a typical corpus-based study is generally as in the image below.

![](assets/images/WorkflowTutorial.png)

This course follows this workflow. I will show you how to conduct a corpus investigation step-by-step, and you will be able to do so by yourself!

# How to get through the exercises

The best (if not only) way to learn how to use programming language is just with practice. There are two ways to do so throughout the tutorial. In either case, I highly recommend to use markdown scripts (to know more about markdown scripts, you can refer to <a href="https://aymeric-collart.github.io/CHU0387/WorkingWithRMarkdown.html" target="_blank">Week 5, Part 2</a>.

-   I will provide at the beginning of each section a markdown file prefilled with the structure of the section. You can download this file and open it with R, and just paste the codes at the relevant sections of the script.
-   Alternatively, you may wish to write the script yourself, and to work based on the codes in each section. This is also a great way to learn how to structure a markdown file alone!
