    "text": "2.2 Documentation of the manual steps\nThis task seems quite easy, but it is crucial. First, you went to the website by clicking on the link. Then, you selected the date of the news you were interested in. Third, you selected the type of news (politics, society, etc.). A list of articles was already there on the website, and you were just filtering them. And to get into one article, you just clicked on one of the titles below the search bar.\nThis procedure looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will do the same, but pay more attention to the web address, and track the changes that occur. For instance, the first step is just accessing the website. The web address is “https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list.htm”. What is the web address when you select a particular date, let’s say October 28th, 2024? And when you select a particular type of article, “politics” for example? And finally, when you choose an individual article?\nHere is what we get:\n\nFirst step: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list.htm\nSecond step (filtered articles): https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm\nThird step: (individual article): https://www.ettoday.net/news/20241028/2843953.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we can see that filtering the data changes the address of the website in a very systematic way. Now, try to change the address to access the list of articles published on September 27th, 2024. You will get something like that: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-09-27-1.htm\nSecond, try to change the last number. You will see that it changes the type of articles.\n\nSo this means that you can filter the list of articles as you wish just by changing the web address!\n\nThird, if we look at the web address of the individual article, we can retrieve the date of publication of the article very easily… but it is not quite possible to guess the numbers after that.\n\n\n\nNo need to despair! The fact that this article is found in the list means that the web address of the individual article must be somewhere on the website… but where? This is the moment when it is important to understand the structure of the website.",

There are different programming languages, but for our purpose, we will only need to look at the lines written in html language.\nLet’s just have a look at line 549 and decompose it.\n\n&lt;div class=\"part_list_2\"&gt;\n  &lt;h3&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"date\"&gt;2024/10/28 20:45&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;em class=\"tag c_news\"&gt;政治&lt;/em&gt;\n    &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ettoday.net/news/20241028/2843953.htm\"&gt;陳吉仲列超思案被告！黃國昌「哇一聲」：北檢終於醒來啦&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThis line corresponds to this part of the website:\n\nNow we can decompose it:\n\nThe part with “&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;” means that there is a block on the webpage. This block corresponds to the one where all the individual articles are listed. There are many blocks on a webpage, so we can give them different names to avoid confusing them. Here, the block is called “part_list_2”.\nThe part with “&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;” corresponds to one line in the block. What is between “&lt;h3&gt;” and “&lt;/h3&gt;” is everything we want to put in that line. Here there are three elements:\n\nThe first element is a “&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” element, and its name is “date”. What is between “&lt;span&gt;” and “&lt;/span&gt;” is the text to display, here: “2024/10/28 20:45”.\nThe second element is an “&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” element (why “em” and not “span”? “em” stands for “emphasis”, so they look different on the website). Its name is “tag c_news”.\nThe third element is an “&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” element. This is used to write a text with a link, and the link is specified with “href”. The term “target=”_blank”” means that it opens in a new page when you click on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis seems to be a lot and quite complicated.\nSo just remember this:\n\nThere are big blocks with different names (div, h3, span, etc.). Let’s call them nodes.\nInside nodes, you can specify the parameters and names specific to the nodes.\n\nThat’s all!",

It is just about translating our behavior to a language that the computer can understand!\nIn other words, we are going to map the steps described in Section 2.2 to R functions to perform the same task. And then we will require R to repeat the same task with different web addresses.\n\n\nAn efficient way to be clear about the steps to proceed with when doing programming language is to translate the steps we went through manually into words that make sense for the computer. For instance, when we select the dates or article types for filtering, we actually store them somewhere as variables. This gives us the annotated figure below.\n\nNow let’s see how to implement these steps with R.",

    "section": "4.3 Step 1: Record the web addresses that list the pages of the individual articles based on the filters",
    "text": "4.3 Step 1: Record the web addresses that list the pages of the individual articles based on the filters\nThe first step in our task is to record the web addresses. Let’s have a first recap:\n\nThe main address is: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list.htm\nThe web address with filters for dates and categories looks like this: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm\n\nNow it is like playing lego: How to obtain the address with filters based on the first address? The answer is as follows:\n\n\"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" + \"-\" + date + \"-\" + category + \".htm\"\n\nWhere dates are like “2024-10-28” and categoriesare just numbers. How to do so with R? Nothing easier!\n\nFirst, store the base address as a variable:\n\n\nETTodayPageUrl &lt;- \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" \n\n\nThen, store the year, month and day of your interest, and paste them together. To paste, we use the function “paste0()”:\n\n\nYear &lt;- 2024\nMonth &lt;- 10\nDay &lt;- 28\n\ndate &lt;- paste0(Year,\n               \"-\",\n               Month,\n               \"-\",\n               Day)\ndate\n\n[1] \"2024-10-28\"\n\n\n\nNow we select the category. Let’s say we want articles talking about politics, coded as “1” on ETtoday:\n\n\ncategory &lt;- 1\n\n\nFinally, we paste these variables together to obtain the address:\n\n\n## Template: \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" + \"-\" + date + \"-\" + category + \".htm\"\nURL &lt;- paste0(ETTodayPageUrl,\n              \"-\",\n              date,\n              \"-\",\n              category,\n              \".htm\")\nURL\n\n[1] \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nYou may think that it is a complex way to do… why not writing the web address as a variable instead of pasting the elements? In other words, why not writing this instead:\nURL &lt;- “https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm”\nThink about it. Doing so, if you want the data for the whole year 2024, and two categories, it means that you will have to do the same more than 700 times… so it seems to be a simpler solution, and it is true if we are working with only one page, but not necessarily with big data!\n\n\nWe have the address corresponding to one page with the code above. If we want the web addresses for the whole year, we will need to repeat the code, and changing the date every time. In programming language, there is a command that tells a computer to repeat the same set of instructions for each item in a list. It is a way to automate a repetitive task. This command is called for loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the concept of for loop?\n\n\n\nYou have a list (your friends at the table) and an action (giving one card). The for loop is the instruction you give yourself: “For each friend at the table, give them one card.”\nYou go to the first friend and give them a card. Then you automatically move to the second friend and do the same thing. You continue this process until every friend in the group has received a card. The loop then stops on its own.\nEvery for loop has three basic components:\n\nThe List (or Collection): The group of items you want to work through. This could be a list of names, numbers, or any collection of data.\nThe Action (or Task): The specific job you want to do for every single item in the list.\nThe Loop: The process that automatically takes one item, performs the action, and then moves on to the next item until the list is finished.\n\n\n\nLet’s have a look at how to apply this concept to our case.\n\nFirst, we start with the base address, as we have already done above:\n\n\nETTodayPageUrl &lt;- \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" \n\n\nThen we create the List. Since we want to go through the articles published in 2024, we want Year 2024, Months from January (1) to December (12), and Days from 1 to 31 (some months do not have 31 days, but it is not crucial for our purpose). This is how we write it:\n\n\nYear &lt;- 2024\nMonth &lt;- 1:12\nDay &lt;- 1:31\n\nYear\n\n[1] 2024\n\nMonth\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\n\nDay\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n[26] 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\n\n\nWe have the List. Now we need the Action. What we want is a list (or table) with all the dates. To do so:\n\nWe create an empty table,\nWe paste Year, Month and Day to obtain the date,\nWe change the class of the variable to match the class of the empty table,\nWe add the individual date into the table\n\n\nThe code looks like that:\n\nDates_total &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n\n# The Action is below\nDates &lt;- paste0(Year, \"-\", Month, \"-\", Day)\nDates &lt;- as.data.frame(Dates)\nDates_total &lt;- rbind(Dates_total, Dates)\n\n# A look at the results\nDates_total\n\n        Dates\n1    2024-1-1\n2    2024-2-2\n3    2024-3-3\n4    2024-4-4\n5    2024-5-5\n6    2024-6-6\n7    2024-7-7\n8    2024-8-8\n9    2024-9-9\n10 2024-10-10\n11 2024-11-11\n12 2024-12-12\n13  2024-1-13\n14  2024-2-14\n15  2024-3-15\n16  2024-4-16\n17  2024-5-17\n18  2024-6-18\n19  2024-7-19\n20  2024-8-20\n21  2024-9-21\n22 2024-10-22\n23 2024-11-23\n24 2024-12-24\n25  2024-1-25\n26  2024-2-26\n27  2024-3-27\n28  2024-4-28\n29  2024-5-29\n30  2024-6-30\n31  2024-7-31\n\n\n\nSo far it gives us an incomplete list of dates. This is because we need to add the third element: The Loop. Here is my way to create the loop:\n\nWe have the Action for one subset of the data only, which means that we need to have a process for each day, and each month. The rationale goes like this:\n\nLoop 1: “For Day number 1, please assign Month number 1, and Year 2024”\nLoop 2: “For Day number 2, please assign Month number 1, and Year 2024”\n… …\nLoop 31: “For Day number 31, please assign Month number 1, and Year 2024”\nLoop 32: “For Day number 1, please assign Month number 2, and Year 2024”\n\nThis means that we have a first round of Loop for Day, followed by a second round of Loop for Month, followed by a third round of Loop for Year.\nThis is why in the code below, there are 3 for loop commands, and different variables are assigned to them:\n\n\n\nDates_total &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n\nfor (a in 1:length(Day)){\n  for (b in 1:length(Month)){\n    for (c in min(Year):max(Year)){\n      Dates &lt;- paste0(c, \"-\", b, \"-\", a)\n      Dates &lt;- as.data.frame(Dates)\n      Dates_total &lt;- rbind(Dates_total, Dates)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nDates_total &lt;- as.character(Dates_total$Dates)\n\nknitr::kable(head(Dates_total)) # Use of the kable() function from the 'knitr' package to have a prettier output\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n2024-1-1\n\n\n2024-2-1\n\n\n2024-3-1\n\n\n2024-4-1\n\n\n2024-5-1\n\n\n2024-6-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we apply the same logic to add the Categories. Let’s say we want articles about “Politics” and “Society”.\n\nIn that case, the List is about categories coded as “1” and “6”\nThe Action is to paste the different parts of the web address\nThe Loop is to paste all the dates (372 dates) to the 2 categories.\nThis gives the following code:\n\n\n\n# \"6.htm\" = \"Society\"\n# \"1.htm\" = \"Politics\"\n# \"2.htm\" = \"International\"\n# \"5.htm\" = \"Life\"\nCategory_total &lt;- c(\"6\", \"1\")\n\nURL_total &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n  \nfor (a in 1:length(Category_total)){\n  URL_temp &lt;- paste0(ETTodayPageUrl, \"-\", Dates_total, \"-\", Category_total[a], \".htm\")\n  URL_temp &lt;- as.data.frame(URL_temp)\n  URL_total &lt;- rbind(URL_total, URL_temp)\n}\n\nURL_total &lt;- as.character(URL_total$URL_temp)\nknitr::kable(head(URL_total)) # Use of the kable() function from the 'knitr' package to have a prettier output\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-1-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-2-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-3-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-4-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-5-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-6-1-6.htm",

    "text": "1.3 The variable block\nThe ‘variable block’ is the one on the top right side, as in the image below.\n\n\n\nBasically, the most important tab is the ‘environment’ one. This is where the variables we create when coding will be stored. The term ‘variable’ can be quite abstract at the moment, so let’s demonstrate this with our first code. R can be used as a simple calculator. In the ‘console block’, just write the following code, end press ‘enter’:\n\n4+2\n\nNormally, you’ll see this:\n\n4+2\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nAnd indeed, ‘4 + 2’ equals 6. Now, let’s play a game. You want to obtain the number 8, but you have to use ‘4 + 2’. One option is to add 2 one more time, and you will write the following code:\n\n4+2+2\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe game may continue, and you will need to write even more. This is when the variables can be useful. Try the following code:\n\na &lt;- 4+2\n\nUnlike what you have seen before, nothing appears in the console anymore. But there is something new in the variable block:\n\n\n\nYou stocked the calculation ‘4+2’ as a variable, and you can call it anytime you want! For example, you can call it by simply writing a in the console, and you can also add 2 to it by writing a + 2, and you’ll see something as follows:\n\n&gt; a\n[1] 6\n&gt; a+2\n[1] 8\n\nThis example is just here to show what the ‘variables’ are. With just simple calculations like the ones above, it seems to be quite useless. But you’ll realize very quickly through this tutorial that variables are not only useful, but also necessary to handle more data.",

You will better understand the importance of the scripts, one more time, with an example. If you’ve followed Section 1.3, you can see that you have the same code as the code below in your console.\n\n&gt; 4+2\n[1] 6\n&gt; a &lt;- 4+2\n&gt; a\n[1] 6\n&gt; a+2\n[1] 8\n\nNow, just close R and reopen it. All the codes disappeared! We usually use R for much more than a simple calculator, and we always end up with hundreds of lines of codes. Imagine if you need to rewrite everything each time you close and reopen R… and this is where the scripts are useful!\nLet’s do a simple exercise with the script. First, open a new script by clicking on “New File”, and then the first option, called “R Script”.\n\n\n\nWrite the lines below in the script block:\n\n4+2\na &lt;- 4+2\na\na+2\n\nAfter that, select everything, and click on ‘Run’. You can also take a look at the short video below.\n\n\n\nThis is how you run a script! Alternatively, you can select everything (or just the line you interested in), and press ‘enter’ on your keyboard. Now you can save your script (“File &gt; Save”) and close R. Find the file you just saved on your computer and open it. Your code is still here!",

For example, if I’m writing more complex lines of codes which could be confusing, I enlarge the script block to be sure I’m not missing any parenthesis or comma. When I’m drawing plots, I make the computer block bigger to visualize more clearly what I’m doing, and it helps me to know if I want to add or change anything on the plot. Everyone’s experience is different, it just depends on what your preferences are. So, really, make it your own!",

For example, you have “Quarto Document” or “R Markdown” which are like “R Script”. The difference is that R Scripts only save your codes, while Quarto Documents or R Markdowns allow more options, and especially to render out in a PDF or markdown file. By doing so, we can share our code along with the output of the code in a beautiful way, which is very important for Open Science!\nYou’ll also remark that even if we are using R, it is actually possible to write with other programming languages, such as HTML or Python. While this is not the case for R Scripts, it is possible with other types of scripts. You can even design a whole website using R, and ask R to transfer your data online… This is indeed how I am designing the website of the tutorial!\nScript files have many very useful options, so many that I decided to dedicate a whole section to it.

    "text": "2.1 What is the concept of the “libraries”?\nYou can do many things with R. Among others:\n\nBasic calculations\nData manipulation\nDraw figures or plots of your data\nCreate geographical maps\nRun simple and advanced statistics (summaries, t-tests, ANOVA, LMR, GLMR, Bayesian statistics, etc.)\nDesign a whole website\nPreprocess neuroimaging data (EEG, fMRI, etc.)\nDownload data from the web to be further manipulated\nCreate applications\n\nAnd many many other possibilities. You may have a sense of it, the more complex the task is, the more codes it requires. For example, it is not the same to calculate ‘2+4’ and putting statistical data on the map of Europe!\nIt can be overwhelming, and we can even have the feeling that quantitative research is not for us after all. Good news! We actually don’t need to write all the codes from scratch!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on the nature of the R project\n\n\n\nR is free and open source, it is a collaborative concept. And it is very important to be aware of this: Nobody, nobody, writes all the raw codes for each task in one script. Just like we read articles and books instead of doing all the research on the field when we want to know more about something, we can rely on other people’s work when writing codes. People wrote, and more importantly, published, articles and books so that we can have access to more knowledge. People wrote, and more importantly, shared online, lines and lines of codes and functions such that we can have access to them, use them, instead of rewriting everything.\n\n\nWe need to introduce some concepts now:\n\nLines of codes\nFunctions\nPackages/Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nConcept\n\n\n\n\nLine of codes\nJust the code you write in the script/console to perform something specific. They are usually the most simple.\n\n\nFunction\nSometimes, you need more than one line of code to perform a task. You may even want to perform the exact same task several times, but with different data. Of course, you can just copy and paste the same code everytime, but you can also choose to simplify it into one line of code. This is what a function is: a cluster of lines of codes\n\n\nLibrary/Package\nAnd very often, you’ll need to perform many tasks which require more than one function. You can choose to write all the functions by hand anytime you need them. Or you can just have them already loaded somewhere in R, such that you can refer to them later when you need them. This is what a library or package is: a cluster of functions\n\n\n\n\nThere are many many packages available for free with R. You can find them here. And they are even more that are not directly available from the R website, but developped and distributed by other people (generally on Github). They always come with a logo, as below.\n\n\n\n\nWe will very often refer to some of them, such as “readxl” to import data from Excel, “ggplot2” to draw figures, “tidyr” and “dplyr” to manipulate data, etc.",

    "text": "2.2 How to install and use libraries?\nInstalling libraries is quite easy. You have two ways to do so:\n\nUsing the Computer block\nSo far, we’ve only mentioned the Computer block as the block where you can browse the folders and open the files on your computer. This block actually has more functions. If you look at the tabs, you will remark that we’ve only talked about the “Files”.\nNow we will turn to the “Packages” tab, as in the image below. What you need to do is to click on “Install”, you write and select the name of the library you want to install, and finally click on “Install”. That’s it!\n\n\n\n\nGive R a couple of minutes while it’s downloading the data and installing on your computer.\n\nUsing the Console block\nAlternatively, you can download/install packages directly from the Console block. You just need to write one line of code:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"[Name of the package you wish to install]\")\n\nFor instance, if you want to install the package ‘ggplot2’, which is used to draw figures, here is what you need to write:\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nYou will remark that for installing the packages, you need to write the name of the package between quotation marks\nNow that you have downloaded the packages you need, this does not mean that you can use the functions in the libraries right away. The packages are installed, but you need to “call” them, or to load them, such that they are ready to use. Note that no quotation marks are used with this function.\n\nlibrary([Name of the package])\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nLet’s keep the metaphor of the articles and books published by other people. You want to prepare a memorable dinner, and to do so you need to buy a book with recipies that you can’t find online. To do so, you go to the bookstore and buy this wonderful book. Back home, you just put it on your bookshelf. The step of buying the book and bringing it back home corresponds to the ‘install.packages()’ step.\nDoes having the book at home mean that you just need to go to your kitchen and start cooking? Of course not! You need to have this book opened with you in the kitchen to follow the recipies! This is exactly what we are doing when we load the packages in the ‘library()’ step!",

The ‘working directory’ refers to the folder in your computer R is looking into. While you can navigate in the folders of your computer using the Computer block, this does not mean that R remembers where you are. To do so, you have to tell R:\n\nThis is THE folder where the files I will load are, THE folder where my script will be saved, THE folder where all my files will be saved\n\nThis is what the ‘working directory’, it is THE folder. Now, how to set your working directory, THE folder?\n\nUse the Computer block to navigate in your computer until you are in the folder you wish to work in,\nClick on the small image of the wheel, and then click on “Save as Working Directory”\n\n\n\n\nAnd you are done! You will see that a line of code appeared in the Console block, actually setting the working directory.",

    "text": "3.2 Your first script: Some syntax and vocabulary of R\n\n3.2.1 Add comments\nA useful tip when writing R code is the possibility to add comments. I use it all the time such that I can annotate why I used this function, the size I want to print my figure, etc. Comments are marked with the hashtag sign “#”. See the example below. Note that you can add as many hashtag signs as you want. I personally have the habit to use three hashtag signs, but you could also just use one.\n\n    ### This is a line of comment. I won't be run in the console, even if it is copied there.\n    2+4 ### We can also add comments after a code. In that case, it will only run the code at the beginning of the line, and ignore everything after the # sign\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nNow that you know how to add comments in the script you have opened, just comment every line, even the ones that you created yourself!\n\n\n3.2.2 Basic calculations\nWe have already referred to basic calculations in the previous subsections. These so-called basic calculations can even be complex, as below.\n\n2 + 343 * 34 / (5 - 342 + 45 * 36)\n\n[1] 11.08963\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Assigning variables\nWe have also already mentioned how to assign variables in previous subsections. Let’s recall it below.\n\na &lt;- 4+2\n\nAnother way to assign variables is by using the equal sign “=”. You just obtain the same results. I prefer using “&lt;-” because I find it visually more salient, but it depends on one’s preference.\n\na = 4+2\n\nYou can also assign strings of letters. For example, you can try to add “This is my first script” to the variable “b”.\n\nb &lt;- This is my first script\n\nYou will remark that… it didn’t work! You surely had the following message:\nError: unexpected symbol in \"b &lt;- This is\"\nThis is “This is my first script” has never been defined in R. In other words, R does not know what you are talking about! If you want to add strings of words, you need to use the quotation marks, as below.\n\nb &lt;- \"This is my first script\"\n\nYou can also assign tables, datasets, plots, etc. You can even assign variables to variables. Try this below:\n\nb &lt;- a\n\nWhat happened here? You had a variable called ‘a’, which had the value “6”. You also had the variable called ‘b’, which had the value “This is my first script”. In the above line of code, you are asking R to assign the value of the variable a to b… in other words, the value of ‘b’ becomes the same as ‘a’!\n\n\n3.2.4 Load data from your computer to R\nYou may have already collected data, and you want to import your dataset into R. For this section, let’s use the data from the survey of “Great American Coffee Taste Test”. You can download the file here. (source of the data: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to place this file in the folder you are working in, and to set this folder as your working directory!\n\n\nNow you have two ways to import the data into R:\n\nwith a line of code, or\nwith the R interface.\n\nLet’s first do it with the code below.\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"/Users/aymeric/Documents/GithubWebsites/CHU03887/assets/files/GACTT_RESULTS_ANONYMIZED_v2.csv\", header=TRUE)\n\nNow let’s decompose this:\n\nread.csv(). This is the function which is used to import the file, which is a CSV file.\nThere are two elements inside the function, which are seperated with a comma:\n\n“~/assets/files/GACTT_RESULTS_ANONYMIZED_v2.csv”. This is the path to access to the file, as well as the full name of the file\nheader=TRUE. This means the first line of the table corresponds to the titles of the columns (you can try and change to “header = FALSE” to see what happens!).\n\nFinally, the dataset is assigned to the variable called “data”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to assign the data to a variable? As I always say, computers are very powerful and very stupid at the same time: they are here to do in a very short amount of time exactly what you tell them to do. In other words, if you only use the “read.csv()” function, it will only read the data, and forget it, that’s it!\nBut what we want to do actually is to read the data and save them into R, such that we can do further manipulations. This is why we need to “save” them using variables!\n\n\nThe second way is to use the R interface. To do so, check you Variable block. You have a tab called “Import Dataset”. Just click on it, and then “From Text (base)…”. A new window will open, and you just have to choose the file you want to import.\nNow you have a new window where you are asked to set the options to import the file:\n\nYou can change the name of the variable it will be assigned to. By default, it is the name of the file. Try to change to “data”.\nYou can also set the option that the first line corresponds to the names or labels of the columns. Where you see “Heading”, click on “Yes”.\nAnd finally, you can click on “Import”.\n\n\n\n\nAnd you are done, now you have a whole dataset ready for manipulation in R!\n\n\n3.2.5 Data description and summary\nI assume here that the dataset we just imported is still present in your environment. Now we will learn quick ways to describe and summarize the data we have.\nThe first step is to understand the structure of the dataset. This can be easily done with the ‘str()’ function.\n\nstr(data)\n\nYou will obtain the following results. For clarity, I only give the first four lines here.\n'data.frame':   4042 obs. of  111 variables:\n $ Submission.ID  : chr  \"gMR29l\" \"BkPN0e\" \"W5G8jj\" \"4xWgGr\" ...\n $ What.is.your.age.  : chr  \"18-24 years old\" \"25-34 years old\" \"25-34 years old\" \"35-44 years old\" ...\n $ How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.   : chr  \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" ...\n $ Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.  : chr  \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" ...\nThis is how to read the data:\n\nThe first line indicates the nature of the dataset. This is a “data frame”, with 4042 rows and 111 columns. Afterwards, the str() function describes these 111 columns.\nThe first column is called “Submission.ID”. The rows consist of strings of characters, and the str() function shows the data of the first four lines.\nThe second column is labelled “What.is.your.age.”, and again it consists of rows of strings of characters.\nThe same logic applies for all the lines.\n\nYou will remark that we are facing a problem. In this survey, the participants were asked their age, and then their results were annotated as “18-24 years old”, “25-34 years old”, etc. In other words, there are groups of age, but when the data were imported, R considered them as strings of characters. Now we need to tell R that there are groups. This is done with the “as.factor()” function.\n\ndata$What.is.your.age. &lt;- as.factor(data$What.is.your.age.)\n\nNow let’s decompose this line:\n\nIn the as.factor() function, we told R the data from which column needed to be transformed into groups. We know that this is the column called “What.is.your.age.” in the dataset called “data”. In R language, we write as follows: data$What.is.your.age.. The dollar sign is here to translate “inside of”\nIf we just write this part, R will only transform this column as a group, but it will not save it. So we need to save this operation in a variable, and as we want to replace the column considered as strings of characters, we do not have to create a new variable: we just use this column!\n\nActually, the same problem occurs for the two following columns:\n\nHow.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., and\nWhere.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.\n\nSo we need to do the same changes.\n\ndata$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. &lt;- as.factor(data$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.)\n\ndata$Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee. &lt;- as.factor(data$Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.)\n\nAnd now let’s run the str() function again. Here are the results of the first four lines:\n'data.frame':   4042 obs. of  111 variables:\n $ Submission.ID  : chr  \"gMR29l\" \"BkPN0e\" \"W5G8jj\" \"4xWgGr\" ...\n $ What.is.your.age. : Factor w/ 8 levels \"\",\"&lt;18 years old\",..: 4 5 5 6 5 8 4 1 5 1 ...\n $ How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. : Factor w/ 7 levels \"\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 ...\n $ Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee. : Factor w/ 66 levels \"\",\"At a cafe\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 1 2 1 ...\nThis is much more informative! For instance, this is telling us that there are 8 groups of age (in R, these are called “levels”). But maybe we would like to know the number of people per group among the 4042 participants. This can be done with the summary() function.\n\nsummary(data)\n\nThis is what you obtain in the Console block:\n\n\n\nHow to read this? It is telling us that there are 1986 respondents in the “25-34 years old” group, 960 in the “35-44 years old” group, etc. Also that there are 1277 people drinking 1 cup of coffee per day, 1663 people 2 cups of coffee per day, etc.\n\n\n3.2.6 Transforming the data: add, delete, change\nTransforming the data is the task we spend the most of out time when doing the research. This can be tedious, but it is crucial to plot the right data and to conduct the right analyses. It is also very important to be aware of what we are doing when transforming the data. The aim is to make them more easily readable for R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nData transformation or data manipulation does not mean new data creation or data selection! We make changes to highlight some results, we select for ease of clarity, but such changes and selections are actually transformations and selection of the form, not the content!\n\n\nYou are actually already familiar with data transformation. In the previous section we have changed the class of the data of three columns: strings of characters to factors. I will exemplify here other changes we can make, but the list is not exhaustive at all.\nYou have surely remarked that there are many columns in the dataset we loaded. Generally, we collect more than we need, in case that in the end, we may need these data. But sometimes, having very large datasets can make us quite confused when trying to read and interpret the data. Therefore, sometimes, we would like a dataset with only the comumns we need. For instance, we have talked of three columns so far in the previous section. We want to select them, in addition to the column indicating the ID of the respondents. We can do so with the code below.\n\ndata2 &lt;- data[,c(\"Submission.ID\",\n                 \"What.is.your.age.\",\n                 \"How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.\",\n                 \"Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.\")]\n\nAgain, let’s decompose this:\n\nThe dataset from which we want to select data is called ‘data’. We select data from it by adding brackets, therefore “data[ ]”.\nThe columns are selected by adding a comma first (there are reasons for this, but it is not important for our purpose now), and then adding the name of the column. For example, we may have written “data[,”Submission.ID”]“, and this selects the columns called ‘Submission.ID’.\nBut we want to select more than one column. Unfortunately, we cannot write the names of all the columns directly. We need to inform R first that there is a list of columns. We use “c()” to do so.\nFinally, we save this into a variable. We may have saved this to “data” (i.e. “data &lt;- data[….]”), but when doing so, we would have overwritten our original data. And if in the end, we realize that we need other columns, we have to redo everything! This is why it is good to have the habit to save into other variables when performing transformations of this kind.\n\nNow we will learn another trick: How to check which groups we have. In other words, how many groups of age are there in the data we have? This can be done as below:\n\nlevels(data2$What.is.your.age.)\n\n[1] \"\"                \"&lt;18 years old\"   \"&gt;65 years old\"   \"18-24 years old\"\n[5] \"25-34 years old\" \"35-44 years old\" \"45-54 years old\" \"55-64 years old\"\n\n\nWe use the level() function, and we inform R which columns we want to look at inside the parentheses. We obtain the results as above.\nThere are 8 groups, but the first one corresponds to people who did not reply. We would like to remove this in order to have a full dataset. If we do not want to do it with other libraries, we can do it as follows:\n\ndata2 &lt;- subset(data2, What.is.your.age. != \"\")\n\ndata2$What.is.your.age. &lt;- droplevels(data2$What.is.your.age.)\n\n\nIn the first line, we are telling R to remove the rows where the group is ““.\n\nTo do so, we use the subset() function. In the parentheses, we set the parameters to tell R which rows to remove: dataset name (“data2”), column (“What.is.your.age.”), level (““).\nNote that we used the sign “!=”. This sign means “remove”. If we change this sign to “==”, it means “select”!\n\nWe only removed the rows corresponding to ““, but not the label. This is the purpose of the second line.\n\nNow you can run the “levels(data2$What.is.your.age.)” again. You will see that the level “” has indeed been removed!\n\nlevels(data2$What.is.your.age.)\n\n[1] \"&lt;18 years old\"   \"&gt;65 years old\"   \"18-24 years old\" \"25-34 years old\"\n[5] \"35-44 years old\" \"45-54 years old\" \"55-64 years old\"\n\n\nIf we look at the column called “How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.”, there is the same problem. We just have to run the same codes to solve this!\n\ndata2 &lt;- subset(data2, How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. != \"\")\n\ndata2$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. &lt;- droplevels(data2$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.)\n\nNow we would like to summarize the number of observations per group. And I will have to make an exception to what I said earlier: We are using the package called “dplyr”. So you will need to download it beforehand.\nHere is the code you need to write:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata3 &lt;- data2 %&gt;% \n  group_by(What.is.your.age., How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.) %&gt;% \n  summarize(Count = n())\n\nLet’s decompose this:\n\nIn the first line, we just loaded the library we need.\nThe sign “%&gt;%” is here to say we are going to run the codes below it based on the dataset called “data2”\nThe “group_by()” function is here to tell R which columns we will take into consideration. Notice that we do not need to write “data2$What.is.your.age.” since we used the “%&gt;%” sign.\nFinally, the last line of code is the transformation we are performing: We want to summarize the data. Inside the “summarize()” function, we need to give the details of what we want to do (notice that you can also write “summarise()”!).\n\nThe “n()” function means that we just want to count the number of observations per group,\nAnd the observations will be found in the “Count” column. Note that you can replace “Count” by any name you want!\n\nAnd finally, we store this summary table into a new variable, which we call “data3”.\n\nYou should obtain something like this in the picture below:\n\n\n\nThere are of course many more ways to transform the data, summarize them, etc. This subsection was only a snapshot of what is possible to do with a very minimum number of lines of codes!\n\n\n3.2.7 Plotting the data\nNow that we have summarized data, we can plot to see what they look like. We will use a very straightforward function, called… “plot()”! Let’s see what it does with the codes below.\n\nplot(x = data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(x = data3$What.is.your.age., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ran into a minor problem: R sorted the groups in alphabetical order, which is not quite straightforward! So we will need to reorder the levels first. Let’s do it with the code below:\n\ndata3$What.is.your.age. &lt;- factor(data3$What.is.your.age., levels = c(\"&lt;18 years old\",\n    \"18-24 years old\",\n    \"25-34 years old\",\n    \"35-44 years old\",\n    \"45-54 years old\",\n    \"55-64 years old\",\n    \"&gt;65 years old\"))\n\ndata3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. &lt;- factor(data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., levels = c(\"Less than 1\",\n         \"1\",\n         \"2\",\n         \"3\",\n         \"4\",\n         \"More than 4\"))\n\nYou can check whether this worked by using the “levels()” function we introduced above.\n\nlevels(data3$What.is.your.age.)\n\n[1] \"&lt;18 years old\"   \"18-24 years old\" \"25-34 years old\" \"35-44 years old\"\n[5] \"45-54 years old\" \"55-64 years old\" \"&gt;65 years old\"  \n\n\n\nlevels(data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.)\n\n[1] \"Less than 1\" \"1\"           \"2\"           \"3\"           \"4\"          \n[6] \"More than 4\"\n\n\nEverything is in the order we want, now we can plot one more time, You will obtain the plots as below!\n\nplot(x = data3$What.is.your.age., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(x = data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first plot shows that most of the participants are between 25 and 34 years old. The second plot indicates that most of the respondents drink between 1 and 2 cups of coffee everyday.\nYou might be curious whether there is an interaction, with older people drinking more coffee than younger people. In other words, you would need three variables in the codes… which is very difficult to do without other packages, espectially the “ggplot2” one! You can try by yourself!\n\n\n3.2.8 Save data from R to your computer\nFor some reason, we may want to save our data in the computer. But we are actually referring to two things at the same time:\n\nSaving the R dataset, and\nExporting the R dataset such that we can open it with other programs.\n\nBoth are doable, and let’s start with the first option with the code below.\n\nsave(data3, file = \"data3.Rdata\")\n\nWe just need the “save()” function, inside which we first tell R the dataset we want to save, and then the name of the file on the computer. We can choose the name of the file by ourself, as long as we do not forget the “.Rdata” extension. Once it is save, we can load the file later using the “load()” function.\n\nload(file = \"data3.Rdata\")\n\nWe may also want to save the data as a .csv file, readable by programs such as Excel. This is done with the code below:\n\nwrite.csv(data3, \"data3.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nLet’s unpack it:\n\nWe use the “write.csv” function, and we provide details inside the parentheses for:\n\nThe name of the dataset we want to export (here, data3),\nThe name we want it to have in our computer (here, data3.csv), and\nthe “row.names = FALSE” is here to say that we do not want the index of the rows. You can try and change to “TRUE” to see what happens.\n\n\nIt is also possible to export to .xlsx files, more directly readable by Excel, but this requires another library. We will encounter this in the rest of the tutorial.\n\n\n3.2.9 R script of this section\nYou can find the R scripts including the codes presented in this section here. Don’t hesitate to use it and add comments for each line of code to make your own!",

We can spend hours trying to figure out what to do to make the codes work. Again, no worries! This is part of the learning process, and to be honest, even experts can’t avoid error messages. The most important thing is to learn from them, so that we are able to understand what the problem is, and how to solve it.\nFrom my experience, there are mistakes we often make especially as first users of R. I remember that many students in the classes I attended and taught gave up on learning programming languages just because they had to spend too much time on debugging very basic mistakes, and they couldn’t focus on the opportunities R can offer. Below is a non-exhaustive list of such mistakes that I may update in the future.\n\n3.3.1 I can’t load the data from my computer\n\n\n3.3.2 I don’t have any error message, but my code won’t run\n\n\n3.3.3 “Variable not found”, what happened?",

    "text": "So far, we have been talking about something called “R/RStudio”. People familiar with this program know what this is about. However, it can be quite confusing when we have never heard of it. We are actually referring to two programs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\nRStudio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main program is called R. This is where all the magic happens. RStudio is a user-friendly interface such that it is easier to work with.\nMaybe a metaphor can help to understand the difference between R and RStudio. As you are engaging yourself in this tutorial, I assume that you have a computer (and that you are using one). You can create folders, open Word or Excel documents, write in it and save them in the folders you created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nNow it is time to reflect on what you are doing. You have done these tasks by using your mouse or your touchpad and clicking on icons (or figures) on your screen. What you may not know is that when doing so, you have run many lines of codes. Actually, it is your computer that ran them in programs able to perform computations. Your role has been to trigger these programs by using the user-friendly interface installed in your computer.\n\n\nThis is the exact same thing with R and RStudio. R will perform the computations that you ask for. And you will ask R to do stuff by clicking on icons and writing commands using the user-friendly interface of RStudio. And this is why you need to download two programs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnecdote\n\n\n\nLet me share a personal anecdote when I just entered graduate school and I had my very first class of language programming for linguistic research. Just before leaving, the instructor said very quickly that we had to, I quote, “download R for next time”. I had never heard of R, and to me, calling a program with only one letter seemed kind of awkward. Therefore, I assumed that I misheard the instructions, or that I missed some information. You can just imagine how surprised I was when I googled “R” and actually found that this existed!",

This is called the YAML part. It looks like this so far:\n\n\n\nYou will remark that there are pre-filled information, such as the title of the document, the name(s) of the author(s), the date and the output format. These are what we were prompted to fill when creating the document! Now you can try to change some things, for instance:\n\nTitle: Change to “My first R Markdown script”\nAuthor: Change to you name\nDate: Change to the date you wish, or even delete this line if you do not wish to add a date\n\n\n\n2.1.2 More advanced features of the YAML block\nYou can also add other pieces of information, for instance:\n\nDate:\nYou have more options, such as defining the format of the date, and maybe more interestingly, create a variable such that you do not have to change the date anytime you save the document. In other words, you may want to have a line specifying something like “This document was last modified on ‘Year-Month-Day’”. Just write as follows:\n\n\ndate: \"This document was last modified on `r Sys.Date()`\"\n\nThe code 2025-10-08 will look at the date of the system of your computer.\n\nTable of contents:\nThe addition of titles in the document is here to help when navigating it. You can also add a table of contents such that it is even easier to navigate. You can also specify how many layers you want to display in the table of contents.\n\n\ntoc: true\ntoc-depth: 4 ## Change this value depending on how many layers you wish to display\n\n\nFormat:\nFor now, the output format is “html”. Just replace with other values according to the output format you want (for example: “pdf_document”).\n\nIn the end, the YAML block should look like this:\n\n    ---\n    title: \"My first R Markdown script\"\n    author: \"Your name\"\n    date: \"This document was last modified on `r Sys.Date()`\"\n    output: pdf_document\n    toc: yes\n    toc-depth: 4\n    ---",

    "text": "2.2 Navigating the file: Titles and subparts\nThe titles and subparts are here to give the overall structure of the document. Please note that they are optional: It is possible to write a whole R Markdown document without any title! But as the code gets longer, it can easily become messy to the point that it is very difficult to understand what we are doing. In other words, the titles and subparts are here to clarify everything!\nAdding titles and subparts is very simple. You just need to click on the button where the header options can be found. For example, if you want to write the title of a main part (let’s say, “1. Introduction”), you click on “Header 1”, and you write the name of the title. It is the same process for subtitles. Let’s say you want a subpart called “1.1 Introduction within the introduction”, you just click on “Header 2” and you write what you want for the subtitle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI personally prefer when the structure is numbered, this is why I add the number of the sections like “1. Introduction”, or “1.1 Introduction of the introduction”. But this is not obligatory and depends on your style!\n\n\nThe titles and subparts are also very important to set the table of contents!",

    "text": "2.3 Writing the content\n\n2.3.1 Writing the narrative\nIt couldn’t be simpler: You can write directly inside the document. Just do not forget to check that the style is set as “Normal” and not “Header 1”, “Header 2”, etc. when doing so!\nThis is a big difference with R Script. Everything you write in an R Script is considered as a code, unless you use the hashtag signs to tell R that this is a comment. In other words, everything that you write in the document is considered as a comment, so do not hesitate to write as much as you want as long as it makes things clearer for you!\n\n\n2.3.2 Writing the code\nIf what we write inside the document is not considered as a code, then how to add one?\nYou Just need to click on “Insert”, then “Code Chunk”, and finally “R”. Normally, a grey code block will appear with {r} at the top line to indicate that this is an R code block. Everything written in this grey block will be considered as R code. You can also add comments inside the block using hashtags as you can do in a typical R Script. Sometimes, R will display simple messages and/or warnings at the same time as you run the code. It is possible to “hide” them, you just need to add the following lines below {r}, as below.\nYour code chunk will look like this:\n\n\n\nFinally, you can run the code chunk without running ALL the document. Can you see the green ‘play’ logo on the top right of the code chunk? You just need to click on it!",
