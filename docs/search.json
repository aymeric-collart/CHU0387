    "text": "2.2 Documentation of the manual steps\nThis task seems quite easy, but it is crucial. First, you went to the website by clicking on the link. Then, you selected the date of the news you were interested in. Third, you selected the type of news (politics, society, etc.). A list of articles was already there on the website, and you were just filtering them. And to get into one article, you just clicked on one of the titles below the search bar.\nThis procedure looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will do the same, but pay more attention to the web address, and track the changes that occur. For instance, the first step is just accessing the website. The web address is “https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list.htm”. What is the web address when you select a particular date, let’s say October 28th, 2024? And when you select a particular type of article, “politics” for example? And finally, when you choose an individual article?\nHere is what we get:\n\nFirst step: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list.htm\nSecond step (filtered articles): https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm\nThird step: (individual article): https://www.ettoday.net/news/20241028/2843953.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we can see that filtering the data changes the address of the website in a very systematic way. Now, try to change the address to access the list of articles published on September 27th, 2024. You will get something like that: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-09-27-1.htm\nSecond, try to change the last number. You will see that it changes the type of articles.\n\nSo this means that you can filter the list of articles as you wish just by changing the web address!\n\nThird, if we look at the web address of the individual article, we can retrieve the date of publication of the article very easily… but it is not quite possible to guess the numbers after that.\n\n\n\nNo need to despair! The fact that this article is found in the list means that the web address of the individual article must be somewhere on the website… but where? This is the moment when it is important to understand the structure of the website.",

There are different programming languages, but for our purpose, we will only need to look at the lines written in html language.\nLet’s just have a look at line 549 and decompose it.\n\n&lt;div class=\"part_list_2\"&gt;\n  &lt;h3&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"date\"&gt;2024/10/28 20:45&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;em class=\"tag c_news\"&gt;政治&lt;/em&gt;\n    &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ettoday.net/news/20241028/2843953.htm\"&gt;陳吉仲列超思案被告！黃國昌「哇一聲」：北檢終於醒來啦&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThis line corresponds to this part of the website:\n\nNow we can decompose it:\n\nThe part with “&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;” means that there is a block on the webpage. This block corresponds to the one where all the individual articles are listed. There are many blocks on a webpage, so we can give them different names to avoid confusing them. Here, the block is called “part_list_2”.\nThe part with “&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;” corresponds to one line in the block. What is between “&lt;h3&gt;” and “&lt;/h3&gt;” is everything we want to put in that line. Here there are three elements:\n\nThe first element is a “&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;” element, and its name is “date”. What is between “&lt;span&gt;” and “&lt;/span&gt;” is the text to display, here: “2024/10/28 20:45”.\nThe second element is an “&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” element (why “em” and not “span”? “em” stands for “emphasis”, so they look different on the website). Its name is “tag c_news”.\nThe third element is an “&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” element. This is used to write a text with a link, and the link is specified with “href”. The term “target=”_blank”” means that it opens in a new page when you click on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis seems to be a lot and quite complicated.\nSo just remember this:\n\nThere are big blocks with different names (div, h3, span, etc.). Let’s call them nodes.\nInside nodes, you can specify the parameters and names specific to the nodes.\n\nThat’s all!",

It is just about translating our behavior to a language that the computer can understand!\nIn other words, we are going to map the steps described in Section 2.2 to R functions to perform the same task. And then we will require R to repeat the same task with different web addresses.\n\n\nAn efficient way to be clear about the steps to proceed with when doing programming language is to translate the steps we went through manually into words that make sense for the computer. For instance, when we select the dates or article types for filtering, we actually store them somewhere as variables. This gives us the annotated figure below.\n\nNow let’s see how to implement these steps with R.",

    "section": "4.3 Step 1: Record the web addresses that list the pages of the individual articles based on the filters",
    "text": "4.3 Step 1: Record the web addresses that list the pages of the individual articles based on the filters\nThe first step in our task is to record the web addresses. Let’s have a first recap:\n\nThe main address is: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list.htm\nThe web address with filters for dates and categories looks like this: https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm\n\nNow it is like playing lego: How to obtain the address with filters based on the first address? The answer is as follows:\n\n\"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" + \"-\" + date + \"-\" + category + \".htm\"\n\nWhere dates are like “2024-10-28” and categoriesare just numbers. How to do so with R? Nothing easier!\n\nFirst, store the base address as a variable:\n\n\nETTodayPageUrl &lt;- \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" \n\n\nThen, store the year, month and day of your interest, and paste them together. To paste, we use the function “paste0()”:\n\n\nYear &lt;- 2024\nMonth &lt;- 10\nDay &lt;- 28\n\ndate &lt;- paste0(Year,\n               \"-\",\n               Month,\n               \"-\",\n               Day)\ndate\n\n[1] \"2024-10-28\"\n\n\n\nNow we select the category. Let’s say we want articles talking about politics, coded as “1” on ETtoday:\n\n\ncategory &lt;- 1\n\n\nFinally, we paste these variables together to obtain the address:\n\n\n## Template: \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" + \"-\" + date + \"-\" + category + \".htm\"\nURL &lt;- paste0(ETTodayPageUrl,\n              \"-\",\n              date,\n              \"-\",\n              category,\n              \".htm\")\nURL\n\n[1] \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nYou may think that it is a complex way to do… why not writing the web address as a variable instead of pasting the elements? In other words, why not writing this instead:\nURL &lt;- “https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-10-28-1.htm”\nThink about it. Doing so, if you want the data for the whole year 2024, and two categories, it means that you will have to do the same more than 700 times… so it seems to be a simpler solution, and it is true if we are working with only one page, but not necessarily with big data!\n\n\nWe have the address corresponding to one page with the code above. If we want the web addresses for the whole year, we will need to repeat the code, and changing the date every time. In programming language, there is a command that tells a computer to repeat the same set of instructions for each item in a list. It is a way to automate a repetitive task. This command is called for loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the concept of for loop?\n\n\n\nYou have a list (your friends at the table) and an action (giving one card). The for loop is the instruction you give yourself: “For each friend at the table, give them one card.”\nYou go to the first friend and give them a card. Then you automatically move to the second friend and do the same thing. You continue this process until every friend in the group has received a card. The loop then stops on its own.\nEvery for loop has three basic components:\n\nThe List (or Collection): The group of items you want to work through. This could be a list of names, numbers, or any collection of data.\nThe Action (or Task): The specific job you want to do for every single item in the list.\nThe Loop: The process that automatically takes one item, performs the action, and then moves on to the next item until the list is finished.\n\n\n\nLet’s have a look at how to apply this concept to our case.\n\nFirst, we start with the base address, as we have already done above:\n\n\nETTodayPageUrl &lt;- \"https://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list\" \n\n\nThen we create the List. Since we want to go through the articles published in 2024, we want Year 2024, Months from January (1) to December (12), and Days from 1 to 31 (some months do not have 31 days, but it is not crucial for our purpose). This is how we write it:\n\n\nYear &lt;- 2024\nMonth &lt;- 1:12\nDay &lt;- 1:31\n\nYear\n\n[1] 2024\n\nMonth\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\n\nDay\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n[26] 26 27 28 29 30 31\n\n\n\nWe have the List. Now we need the Action. What we want is a list (or table) with all the dates. To do so:\n\nWe create an empty table,\nWe paste Year, Month and Day to obtain the date,\nWe change the class of the variable to match the class of the empty table,\nWe add the individual date into the table\n\n\nThe code looks like that:\n\nDates_total &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n\n# The Action is below\nDates &lt;- paste0(Year, \"-\", Month, \"-\", Day)\nDates &lt;- as.data.frame(Dates)\nDates_total &lt;- rbind(Dates_total, Dates)\n\n# A look at the results\nDates_total\n\n        Dates\n1    2024-1-1\n2    2024-2-2\n3    2024-3-3\n4    2024-4-4\n5    2024-5-5\n6    2024-6-6\n7    2024-7-7\n8    2024-8-8\n9    2024-9-9\n10 2024-10-10\n11 2024-11-11\n12 2024-12-12\n13  2024-1-13\n14  2024-2-14\n15  2024-3-15\n16  2024-4-16\n17  2024-5-17\n18  2024-6-18\n19  2024-7-19\n20  2024-8-20\n21  2024-9-21\n22 2024-10-22\n23 2024-11-23\n24 2024-12-24\n25  2024-1-25\n26  2024-2-26\n27  2024-3-27\n28  2024-4-28\n29  2024-5-29\n30  2024-6-30\n31  2024-7-31\n\n\n\nSo far it gives us an incomplete list of dates. This is because we need to add the third element: The Loop. Here is my way to create the loop:\n\nWe have the Action for one subset of the data only, which means that we need to have a process for each day, and each month. The rationale goes like this:\n\nLoop 1: “For Day number 1, please assign Month number 1, and Year 2024”\nLoop 2: “For Day number 2, please assign Month number 1, and Year 2024”\n… …\nLoop 31: “For Day number 31, please assign Month number 1, and Year 2024”\nLoop 32: “For Day number 1, please assign Month number 2, and Year 2024”\n\nThis means that we have a first round of Loop for Day, followed by a second round of Loop for Month, followed by a third round of Loop for Year.\nThis is why in the code below, there are 3 for loop commands, and different variables are assigned to them:\n\n\n\nDates_total &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n\nfor (a in 1:length(Day)){\n  for (b in 1:length(Month)){\n    for (c in min(Year):max(Year)){\n      Dates &lt;- paste0(c, \"-\", b, \"-\", a)\n      Dates &lt;- as.data.frame(Dates)\n      Dates_total &lt;- rbind(Dates_total, Dates)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nDates_total &lt;- as.character(Dates_total$Dates)\n\nknitr::kable(head(Dates_total)) # Use of the kable() function from the 'knitr' package to have a prettier output\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n2024-1-1\n\n\n2024-2-1\n\n\n2024-3-1\n\n\n2024-4-1\n\n\n2024-5-1\n\n\n2024-6-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we apply the same logic to add the Categories. Let’s say we want articles about “Politics” and “Society”.\n\nIn that case, the List is about categories coded as “1” and “6”\nThe Action is to paste the different parts of the web address\nThe Loop is to paste all the dates (372 dates) to the 2 categories.\nThis gives the following code:\n\n\n\n# \"6.htm\" = \"Society\"\n# \"1.htm\" = \"Politics\"\n# \"2.htm\" = \"International\"\n# \"5.htm\" = \"Life\"\nCategory_total &lt;- c(\"6\", \"1\")\n\nURL_total &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n  \nfor (a in 1:length(Category_total)){\n  URL_temp &lt;- paste0(ETTodayPageUrl, \"-\", Dates_total, \"-\", Category_total[a], \".htm\")\n  URL_temp &lt;- as.data.frame(URL_temp)\n  URL_total &lt;- rbind(URL_total, URL_temp)\n}\n\nURL_total &lt;- as.character(URL_total$URL_temp)\nknitr::kable(head(URL_total)) # Use of the kable() function from the 'knitr' package to have a prettier output\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-1-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-2-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-3-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-4-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-5-1-6.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/news-list-2024-6-1-6.htm",

    "text": "4.4 Step 2: Retrieve the URLs of the individual articles\nNow we have the web addresses that list the webpages of individual articles, filtered by dates and categories. The next step is to find the web addresses of these individual articles. There are several sub-steps:\n\nFirst, R needs to read the webpage with the list of addresses. Please be aware that when R reads the webpage, we are talking about the structure of the webpage!\n\nThe R function to do so is called “read_html()”.\nWe write the address of the webpage to read between the parentheses. Here, we already have the list from the previous step, and we stored them under the variable “URL_total”.\nWe just test with only one page for the moment. This is why in the code below, we write “URL_total[1]”. It means “the first data in the list called URL_total”.\n\n\n\nIndPage &lt;- read_html(URL_total[1])\nIndPage\n\n{html_document}\n&lt;html lang=\"zh-Hant\" prefix=\"og:http://ogp.me/ns#\" xmlns:wb=\"http://open.weibo.com/wb\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebSite\"&gt;\n[1] &lt;head&gt;\\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...\n[2] &lt;body&gt;\\r\\n\\n&lt;!-- FB Quote 選取文字分享 開始--&gt;\\n&lt;div class=\"fb-quote\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;!- ...\n\n\n\nThe second step is to retrieve the information that we need. We have already done that in Section 3, and if you remember well, we found the line corresponding to the data we want:\n\n\n&lt;div class=\"part_list_2\"&gt;\n  &lt;h3&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"date\"&gt;2024/10/28 20:45&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;em class=\"tag c_news\"&gt;政治&lt;/em&gt;\n    &lt;a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ettoday.net/news/20241028/2843953.htm\"&gt;陳吉仲列超思案被告！黃國昌「哇一聲」：北檢終於醒來啦&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIf you need to describe, you have to say something like that:\n\"The address of the individual article is listed after the 'href' attribute, which is in the &lt;a&gt; node, which is in the &lt;h3&gt; node, which is in the &lt;div&gt; node whose class is 'part_list_2' \".\nHow to translate into R? We will use two functions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nUse\nExample in our case\n\n\n\n\nhtml_nodes()\nUsed to identify the elements within a node\nhtml_nodes(“div”) = retrieves all the nodes starting with “div”\nhtml_nodes(“div.something”) = retrieves only the nodes starting with “div”, where ‘class = “something”’ (in other words, it filters specific “div” nodes)\n\n\nhtml_attr()\nUsed to identify the content of the specification of a node\nhtml_attr(“class”) = retrieves the element written after “class”. For example, in the case below, it will return “NameOfTheClass”.\n&lt;div class=“NameOfTheClass”&gt;\n\n\n\nNow that we know how to use the code, we can translate the description we wrote as follows:\n\nnews_url &lt;- IndPage %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(\"div.part_list_2\") %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(\"h3\") %&gt;%\n  html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;%\n  html_attr(\"href\")\n\nknitr::kable(head(news_url)) # Use of the kable() function from the 'knitr' package to have a prettier output on the website\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655300.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655313.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655305.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655303.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655277.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655264.htm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nLet’s say that you wanted the date or the category of the articles, how would you change this code?\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You have the list of the addresses from one page! Now we need to repeat the same process to the other 743 lists… and anytime you need to repeat a task over and over, this means for loop command! Here are the elements we need:\n\nFirst, we create an empty data frame in which we will store all the web addresses of the individual articles\nThe List is the addresses of the webpages where we can find the individual articles filtered by date and category, which we stored in the variable called “URL_total”,\nThe Action is to find the web addresses of the individual articles, as we did just before,\nThe Loop is to perform the Action for all the filtered pages, and to paste the individual web addresses in the empty data frame we just created.\nThis gives the following code:\n\n\n\n## This step can last several minutes\nURL_IndArticles &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n\nfor (i in 1:length(URL_total)){\n  IndPage &lt;- read_html(URL_total[i])\n  news_url &lt;- IndPage %&gt;% \n    html_nodes(\"div.part_list_2\") %&gt;% \n    html_nodes(\"h3\") %&gt;%\n    html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;%\n    html_attr(\"href\")\n  \n  news_url &lt;- as.data.frame(news_url)\n  URL_IndArticles &lt;- rbind(URL_IndArticles, news_url)\n}\n\n\nWe are not completely done. It is possible that for some reasons, some articles are repeated. So the next step is to remove all the repeated web addresses, by keeping only one instance. Here is how we do that: We use the ‘unique()’ function:\n\n\narticle_overview_unique &lt;- unique(URL_IndArticles)\n\nknitr::kable(head(article_overview_unique)) # Use of the kable() function from the 'knitr' package to have a prettier output on the website\n\n\n\n\nnews_url\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655300.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655313.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655305.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655303.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655277.htm\n\n\nhttps://www.ettoday.net/news/20240101/2655264.htm",

    "text": "4.5 Step 3: Retrieve the titles, date, types and content of the articles\nWe are already half-way to the end! Now that we have the list of the web addresses of the articles published in 2024, we can scrape their content in addition to other information we might need, including the date of publication and the title of the article.\n\nTest with one article\nAs in the previous step, it is safer to test first with one article. The reason is that as some steps require quite a long time to be completed, so it is better to identify potential problems before by testing with only one subset of the data. Again, we have to go through different sub-steps:\n\nFirst, we use the “read_html()” function to read the structure of the web page of one article:\n\n\nOneArticle &lt;- read_html(article_overview_unique$news_url[1])\n\n\nAfter “playing hide and seek” with the structure of the page, we can identify the nodes under which the content we want can be found. Let’s start with the date of publication, which is here:\n\n\n&lt;time class=\"date\" itemprop=\"datePublished\" datetime=\"2024-01-01T22:47:00+08:00\"&gt;                                    2024年01月01日 22:47                                       &lt;/time&gt;\n\nWe can see that it is inside the &lt;time&gt; node (between &lt;time&gt; and &lt;/time&gt;). Therefore, in addition to the “html_nodes()” function, we specify that we want the text within, hence the use of “html_text()” function. The option “trim = TRUE” is just to remove coding format in the text.\nFinally, we store this piece of information in the variable called “news_time”.\n\n# Date of publication\nnews_time &lt;- OneArticle %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(\"time\") %&gt;% \n  html_text(trim = TRUE)\n\n\nAnd now we proceed the same way for the category of the article, and its title:\n\n\n# Category of news\nnews_class &lt;- OneArticle %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(\".part_menu_5\") %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(\"strong\") %&gt;%\n  html_text(trim = TRUE)\n\n# title \nnews_title &lt;- OneArticle %&gt;% \n  html_nodes(\"h1\") %&gt;% \n  html_text(trim = TRUE)\n\n# content \nnews_body &lt;- OneArticle %&gt;% \n  html_nodes('div[itemprop=\"articleBody\"]') %&gt;% \n  html_text(trim = TRUE)\n\n\nOnce it is done, we store these five variables in the same table:\n\n\narticle &lt;- (data.frame(time = news_time,\n                       class = news_class,\n                       title = news_title,\n                       body = news_body,\n                       url = article_overview_unique$news_url[1]))\n\n\nAnd now we can have a look at what we get with one article:\n\n\n# Use of the paged_table() function from the 'rmarkdown' package to have a readable output\nrmarkdown::paged_table(article)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat the same process with all the articles\nAnd if you were following the rationale of these two weeks’ tutorial, you know that when we repeat the same action again and again, it is a better idea to use the for loop command:\n\nFirst, we create an empty data frame in which we will store all the information we want. Let’s call it “Article_total”.\nThe List is the addresses of the individual articles, which we stored in the variable called “article_overview_unique$news_url”,\nThe Action is to find the date of publication, the category of article, the content of the article, its title, and its web address, as we did just before,\nThe Loop is to perform the Action for individual articles, and to include them in the empty data frame we just created.\nYou will remark something new: “tryCatch({”, and at the end “}, error=function(e){cat(”ERROR :“,conditionMessage(e),”“)})”. This is because the for loop command stops anytime an error occurs (which can happen with a broken link, missing information on one article, etc.).\n\nWrapping the Action with the “tryCatch({})” function is just to say that the for loop can ignore the errors and keep proceeding to the next article,\nThe “error=function(e){cat(”ERROR :“,conditionMessage(e),”“)})” part is just to report the error message in the console.\nThis gives the following code:\n\n\n\nArticle_total &lt;- data.frame()\n\nfor (j in 1:length(article_overview_unique$news_url)){\n  tryCatch({\n    temp &lt;- read_html(article_overview_unique$news_url[j])\n    \n    # Date of publication\n    news_time &lt;- temp %&gt;% \n      html_nodes(\"time\") %&gt;% \n      html_text(trim = TRUE)\n    \n    # Category of news\n    news_class &lt;- temp %&gt;% \n      html_nodes(\".part_menu_5\") %&gt;% \n      html_nodes(\"strong\") %&gt;%\n      html_text(trim = TRUE)\n    \n    # title \n    news_title &lt;- temp %&gt;% \n      html_nodes(\"h1\") %&gt;% \n      html_text(trim = TRUE)\n    \n    # content \n    news_body &lt;- temp %&gt;% \n      html_nodes('div[itemprop=\"articleBody\"]') %&gt;% \n      html_text(trim = TRUE)\n    \n    # url\n    news_url &lt;- temp %&gt;% \n      html_nodes(\"div.block div.block_content div.part_list_2 h3\") %&gt;% \n      html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;%\n      html_attr(\"href\")\n    \n    Article &lt;- (data.frame(time = news_time,\n                           class = news_class,\n                           title = news_title,\n                           body = news_body,\n                           url = article_overview_unique$news_url[j]))\n    Article_total &lt;- rbind(Article_total, Article)\n  }, error=function(e){cat(\"ERROR :\",conditionMessage(e), \"\\n\")})\n}\n\n# Use of the paged_table() function from the 'rmarkdown' package to have a readable output\nrmarkdown::paged_table(head(Article_total))\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe careful!!\n\n\n\nThis step can take a very long time! For me, scrapping the articles published in 2024 in these two categories can take 4 hours! You cannot use R when it is working. But you can still use your computer for any other task. So plan accordingly!",

    "text": "1.3 The variable block\nThe ‘variable block’ is the one on the top right side, as in the image below.\n\n\n\nBasically, the most important tab is the ‘environment’ one. This is where the variables we create when coding will be stored. The term ‘variable’ can be quite abstract at the moment, so let’s demonstrate this with our first code. R can be used as a simple calculator. In the ‘console block’, just write the following code, end press ‘enter’:\n\n4+2\n\nNormally, you’ll see this:\n\n4+2\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nAnd indeed, ‘4 + 2’ equals 6. Now, let’s play a game. You want to obtain the number 8, but you have to use ‘4 + 2’. One option is to add 2 one more time, and you will write the following code:\n\n4+2+2\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe game may continue, and you will need to write even more. This is when the variables can be useful. Try the following code:\n\na &lt;- 4+2\n\nUnlike what you have seen before, nothing appears in the console anymore. But there is something new in the variable block:\n\n\n\nYou stocked the calculation ‘4+2’ as a variable, and you can call it anytime you want! For example, you can call it by simply writing a in the console, and you can also add 2 to it by writing a + 2, and you’ll see something as follows:\n\n&gt; a\n[1] 6\n&gt; a+2\n[1] 8\n\nThis example is just here to show what the ‘variables’ are. With just simple calculations like the ones above, it seems to be quite useless. But you’ll realize very quickly through this tutorial that variables are not only useful, but also necessary to handle more data.",

The console block is the place where the code is written and being run.\nIn addition to the ‘Console’ tab, there are also the ‘Terminal’ tab and the ‘Background Jobs’ tab. Despite their importance, we won’t have have to use them in this tutorial. So let’s just skip them!",

    "text": "1.5 The script block\nThe ‘script’ block is where you’ll work most of the time. You can see it as the Word or the Notepad of RStudio. You will better understand the importance of the scripts, one more time, with an example. If you’ve followed Section 1.3, you can see that you have the same code as the code below in your console.\n\n&gt; 4+2\n[1] 6\n&gt; a &lt;- 4+2\n&gt; a\n[1] 6\n&gt; a+2\n[1] 8\n\nNow, just close R and reopen it. All the codes disappeared! We usually use R for much more than a simple calculator, and we always end up with hundreds of lines of codes. Imagine if you need to rewrite everything each time you close and reopen R… and this is where the scripts are useful!\nLet’s do a simple exercise with the script. First, open a new script by clicking on “New File”, and then the first option, called “R Script”.\n\n\n\nWrite the lines below in the script block:\n\n4+2\na &lt;- 4+2\na\na+2\n\nAfter that, select everything, and click on ‘Run’. You can also take a look at the short video below.\n\n\n\nThis is how you run a script! Alternatively, you can select everything (or just the line you interested in), and press ‘enter’ on your keyboard. Now you can save your script (“File &gt; Save”) and close R. Find the file you just saved on your computer and open it. Your code is still here!",

For example, if I’m writing more complex lines of codes which could be confusing, I enlarge the script block to be sure I’m not missing any parenthesis or comma. When I’m drawing plots, I make the computer block bigger to visualize more clearly what I’m doing, and it helps me to know if I want to add or change anything on the plot. Everyone’s experience is different, it just depends on what your preferences are. So, really, make it your own!",

For example, you have “Quarto Document” or “R Markdown” which are like “R Script”. The difference is that R Scripts only save your codes, while Quarto Documents or R Markdowns allow more options, and especially to render out in a PDF or markdown file. By doing so, we can share our code along with the output of the code in a beautiful way, which is very important for Open Science!\nYou’ll also remark that even if we are using R, it is actually possible to write with other programming languages, such as HTML or Python. While this is not the case for R Scripts, it is possible with other types of scripts. You can even design a whole website using R, and ask R to transfer your data online… This is indeed how I am designing the website of the tutorial!\nScript files have many very useful options, so many that I decided to dedicate a whole section to it.

    "text": "2.1 What is the concept of the “libraries”?\nYou can do many things with R. Among others:\n\nBasic calculations\nData manipulation\nDraw figures or plots of your data\nCreate geographical maps\nRun simple and advanced statistics (summaries, t-tests, ANOVA, LMR, GLMR, Bayesian statistics, etc.)\nDesign a whole website\nPreprocess neuroimaging data (EEG, fMRI, etc.)\nDownload data from the web to be further manipulated\nCreate applications\n\nAnd many many other possibilities. You may have a sense of it, the more complex the task is, the more codes it requires. For example, it is not the same to calculate ‘2+4’ and putting statistical data on the map of Europe!\nIt can be overwhelming, and we can even have the feeling that quantitative research is not for us after all. Good news! We actually don’t need to write all the codes from scratch!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on the nature of the R project\n\n\n\nR is free and open source, it is a collaborative concept. And it is very important to be aware of this: Nobody, nobody, writes all the raw codes for each task in one script. Just like we read articles and books instead of doing all the research on the field when we want to know more about something, we can rely on other people’s work when writing codes. People wrote, and more importantly, published, articles and books so that we can have access to more knowledge. People wrote, and more importantly, shared online, lines and lines of codes and functions such that we can have access to them, use them, instead of rewriting everything.\n\n\nWe need to introduce some concepts now:\n\nLines of codes\nFunctions\nPackages/Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nConcept\n\n\n\n\nLine of codes\nJust the code you write in the script/console to perform something specific. They are usually the most simple.\n\n\nFunction\nSometimes, you need more than one line of code to perform a task. You may even want to perform the exact same task several times, but with different data. Of course, you can just copy and paste the same code everytime, but you can also choose to simplify it into one line of code. This is what a function is: a cluster of lines of codes\n\n\nLibrary/Package\nAnd very often, you’ll need to perform many tasks which require more than one function. You can choose to write all the functions by hand anytime you need them. Or you can just have them already loaded somewhere in R, such that you can refer to them later when you need them. This is what a library or package is: a cluster of functions\n\n\n\n\nThere are many many packages available for free with R. You can find them here. And they are even more that are not directly available from the R website, but developped and distributed by other people (generally on Github). They always come with a logo, as below.\n\n\n\n\nWe will very often refer to some of them, such as “readxl” to import data from Excel, “ggplot2” to draw figures, “tidyr” and “dplyr” to manipulate data, etc.",

    "text": "2.2 How to install and use libraries?\nInstalling libraries is quite easy. You have two ways to do so:\n\nUsing the Computer block\nSo far, we’ve only mentioned the Computer block as the block where you can browse the folders and open the files on your computer. This block actually has more functions. If you look at the tabs, you will remark that we’ve only talked about the “Files”.\nNow we will turn to the “Packages” tab, as in the image below. What you need to do is to click on “Install”, you write and select the name of the library you want to install, and finally click on “Install”. That’s it!\n\n\n\n\nGive R a couple of minutes while it’s downloading the data and installing on your computer.\n\nUsing the Console block\nAlternatively, you can download/install packages directly from the Console block. You just need to write one line of code:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"[Name of the package you wish to install]\")\n\nFor instance, if you want to install the package ‘ggplot2’, which is used to draw figures, here is what you need to write:\n\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\nYou will remark that for installing the packages, you need to write the name of the package between quotation marks\nNow that you have downloaded the packages you need, this does not mean that you can use the functions in the libraries right away. The packages are installed, but you need to “call” them, or to load them, such that they are ready to use. Note that no quotation marks are used with this function.\n\nlibrary([Name of the package])\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nLet’s keep the metaphor of the articles and books published by other people. You want to prepare a memorable dinner, and to do so you need to buy a book with recipies that you can’t find online. To do so, you go to the bookstore and buy this wonderful book. Back home, you just put it on your bookshelf. The step of buying the book and bringing it back home corresponds to the ‘install.packages()’ step.\nDoes having the book at home mean that you just need to go to your kitchen and start cooking? Of course not! You need to have this book opened with you in the kitchen to follow the recipies! This is exactly what we are doing when we load the packages in the ‘library()’ step!",

To do so, you have to tell R:\n\nThis is THE folder where the files I will load are, THE folder where my script will be saved, THE folder where all my files will be saved\n\nThis is what the ‘working directory’, it is THE folder. Now, how to set your working directory, THE folder?\n\nUse the Computer block to navigate in your computer until you are in the folder you wish to work in,\nClick on the small image of the wheel, and then click on “Save as Working Directory”\n\n\n\n\nAnd you are done!

    "text": "3.2 Your first script: Some syntax and vocabulary of R\n\n3.2.1 Add comments\nA useful tip when writing R code is the possibility to add comments. I use it all the time such that I can annotate why I used this function, the size I want to print my figure, etc. Comments are marked with the hashtag sign “#”. See the example below. Note that you can add as many hashtag signs as you want. I personally have the habit to use three hashtag signs, but you could also just use one.\n\n    ### This is a line of comment. I won't be run in the console, even if it is copied there.\n    2+4 ### We can also add comments after a code. In that case, it will only run the code at the beginning of the line, and ignore everything after the # sign\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nNow that you know how to add comments in the script you have opened, just comment every line, even the ones that you created yourself!\n\n\n3.2.2 Basic calculations\nWe have already referred to basic calculations in the previous subsections. These so-called basic calculations can even be complex, as below.\n\n2 + 343 * 34 / (5 - 342 + 45 * 36)\n\n[1] 11.08963\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Assigning variables\nWe have also already mentioned how to assign variables in previous subsections. Let’s recall it below.\n\na &lt;- 4+2\n\nAnother way to assign variables is by using the equal sign “=”. You just obtain the same results. I prefer using “&lt;-” because I find it visually more salient, but it depends on one’s preference.\n\na = 4+2\n\nYou can also assign strings of letters. For example, you can try to add “This is my first script” to the variable “b”.\n\nb &lt;- This is my first script\n\nYou will remark that… it didn’t work! You surely had the following message:\nError: unexpected symbol in \"b &lt;- This is\"\nThis is “This is my first script” has never been defined in R. In other words, R does not know what you are talking about! If you want to add strings of words, you need to use the quotation marks, as below.\n\nb &lt;- \"This is my first script\"\n\nYou can also assign tables, datasets, plots, etc. You can even assign variables to variables. Try this below:\n\nb &lt;- a\n\nWhat happened here? You had a variable called ‘a’, which had the value “6”. You also had the variable called ‘b’, which had the value “This is my first script”. In the above line of code, you are asking R to assign the value of the variable a to b… in other words, the value of ‘b’ becomes the same as ‘a’!\n\n\n3.2.4 Load data from your computer to R\nYou may have already collected data, and you want to import your dataset into R. For this section, let’s use the data from the survey of “Great American Coffee Taste Test”. You can download the file here. (source of the data: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to place this file in the folder you are working in, and to set this folder as your working directory!\n\n\nNow you have two ways to import the data into R:\n\nwith a line of code, or\nwith the R interface.\n\nLet’s first do it with the code below.\n\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"/Users/aymeric/Documents/GithubWebsites/CHU03887/assets/files/GACTT_RESULTS_ANONYMIZED_v2.csv\", header=TRUE)\n\nNow let’s decompose this:\n\nread.csv(). This is the function which is used to import the file, which is a CSV file.\nThere are two elements inside the function, which are seperated with a comma:\n\n“~/assets/files/GACTT_RESULTS_ANONYMIZED_v2.csv”. This is the path to access to the file, as well as the full name of the file\nheader=TRUE. This means the first line of the table corresponds to the titles of the columns (you can try and change to “header = FALSE” to see what happens!).\n\nFinally, the dataset is assigned to the variable called “data”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to assign the data to a variable? As I always say, computers are very powerful and very stupid at the same time: they are here to do in a very short amount of time exactly what you tell them to do. In other words, if you only use the “read.csv()” function, it will only read the data, and forget it, that’s it!\nBut what we want to do actually is to read the data and save them into R, such that we can do further manipulations. This is why we need to “save” them using variables!\n\n\nThe second way is to use the R interface. To do so, check you Variable block. You have a tab called “Import Dataset”. Just click on it, and then “From Text (base)…”. A new window will open, and you just have to choose the file you want to import.\nNow you have a new window where you are asked to set the options to import the file:\n\nYou can change the name of the variable it will be assigned to. By default, it is the name of the file. Try to change to “data”.\nYou can also set the option that the first line corresponds to the names or labels of the columns. Where you see “Heading”, click on “Yes”.\nAnd finally, you can click on “Import”.\n\n\n\n\nAnd you are done, now you have a whole dataset ready for manipulation in R!\n\n\n3.2.5 Data description and summary\nI assume here that the dataset we just imported is still present in your environment. Now we will learn quick ways to describe and summarize the data we have.\nThe first step is to understand the structure of the dataset. This can be easily done with the ‘str()’ function.\n\nstr(data)\n\nYou will obtain the following results. For clarity, I only give the first four lines here.\n'data.frame':   4042 obs. of  111 variables:\n $ Submission.ID  : chr  \"gMR29l\" \"BkPN0e\" \"W5G8jj\" \"4xWgGr\" ...\n $ What.is.your.age.  : chr  \"18-24 years old\" \"25-34 years old\" \"25-34 years old\" \"35-44 years old\" ...\n $ How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.   : chr  \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" ...\n $ Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.  : chr  \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" ...\nThis is how to read the data:\n\nThe first line indicates the nature of the dataset. This is a “data frame”, with 4042 rows and 111 columns. Afterwards, the str() function describes these 111 columns.\nThe first column is called “Submission.ID”. The rows consist of strings of characters, and the str() function shows the data of the first four lines.\nThe second column is labelled “What.is.your.age.”, and again it consists of rows of strings of characters.\nThe same logic applies for all the lines.\n\nYou will remark that we are facing a problem. In this survey, the participants were asked their age, and then their results were annotated as “18-24 years old”, “25-34 years old”, etc. In other words, there are groups of age, but when the data were imported, R considered them as strings of characters. Now we need to tell R that there are groups. This is done with the “as.factor()” function.\n\ndata$What.is.your.age. &lt;- as.factor(data$What.is.your.age.)\n\nNow let’s decompose this line:\n\nIn the as.factor() function, we told R the data from which column needed to be transformed into groups. We know that this is the column called “What.is.your.age.” in the dataset called “data”. In R language, we write as follows: data$What.is.your.age.. The dollar sign is here to translate “inside of”\nIf we just write this part, R will only transform this column as a group, but it will not save it. So we need to save this operation in a variable, and as we want to replace the column considered as strings of characters, we do not have to create a new variable: we just use this column!\n\nActually, the same problem occurs for the two following columns:\n\nHow.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., and\nWhere.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.\n\nSo we need to do the same changes.\n\ndata$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. &lt;- as.factor(data$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.)\n\ndata$Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee. &lt;- as.factor(data$Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.)\n\nAnd now let’s run the str() function again. Here are the results of the first four lines:\n'data.frame':   4042 obs. of  111 variables:\n $ Submission.ID  : chr  \"gMR29l\" \"BkPN0e\" \"W5G8jj\" \"4xWgGr\" ...\n $ What.is.your.age. : Factor w/ 8 levels \"\",\"&lt;18 years old\",..: 4 5 5 6 5 8 4 1 5 1 ...\n $ How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. : Factor w/ 7 levels \"\",\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 ...\n $ Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee. : Factor w/ 66 levels \"\",\"At a cafe\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 10 1 2 1 ...\nThis is much more informative! For instance, this is telling us that there are 8 groups of age (in R, these are called “levels”). But maybe we would like to know the number of people per group among the 4042 participants. This can be done with the summary() function.\n\nsummary(data)\n\nThis is what you obtain in the Console block:\n\n\n\nHow to read this? It is telling us that there are 1986 respondents in the “25-34 years old” group, 960 in the “35-44 years old” group, etc. Also that there are 1277 people drinking 1 cup of coffee per day, 1663 people 2 cups of coffee per day, etc.\n\n\n3.2.6 Transforming the data: add, delete, change\nTransforming the data is the task we spend the most of out time when doing the research. This can be tedious, but it is crucial to plot the right data and to conduct the right analyses. It is also very important to be aware of what we are doing when transforming the data. The aim is to make them more easily readable for R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nData transformation or data manipulation does not mean new data creation or data selection! We make changes to highlight some results, we select for ease of clarity, but such changes and selections are actually transformations and selection of the form, not the content!\n\n\nYou are actually already familiar with data transformation. In the previous section we have changed the class of the data of three columns: strings of characters to factors. I will exemplify here other changes we can make, but the list is not exhaustive at all.\nYou have surely remarked that there are many columns in the dataset we loaded. Generally, we collect more than we need, in case that in the end, we may need these data. But sometimes, having very large datasets can make us quite confused when trying to read and interpret the data. Therefore, sometimes, we would like a dataset with only the comumns we need. For instance, we have talked of three columns so far in the previous section. We want to select them, in addition to the column indicating the ID of the respondents. We can do so with the code below.\n\ndata2 &lt;- data[,c(\"Submission.ID\",\n                 \"What.is.your.age.\",\n                 \"How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.\",\n                 \"Where.do.you.typically.drink.coffee.\")]\n\nAgain, let’s decompose this:\n\nThe dataset from which we want to select data is called ‘data’. We select data from it by adding brackets, therefore “data[ ]”.\nThe columns are selected by adding a comma first (there are reasons for this, but it is not important for our purpose now), and then adding the name of the column. For example, we may have written “data[,”Submission.ID”]“, and this selects the columns called ‘Submission.ID’.\nBut we want to select more than one column. Unfortunately, we cannot write the names of all the columns directly. We need to inform R first that there is a list of columns. We use “c()” to do so.\nFinally, we save this into a variable. We may have saved this to “data” (i.e. “data &lt;- data[….]”), but when doing so, we would have overwritten our original data. And if in the end, we realize that we need other columns, we have to redo everything! This is why it is good to have the habit to save into other variables when performing transformations of this kind.\n\nNow we will learn another trick: How to check which groups we have. In other words, how many groups of age are there in the data we have? This can be done as below:\n\nlevels(data2$What.is.your.age.)\n\n[1] \"\"                \"&lt;18 years old\"   \"&gt;65 years old\"   \"18-24 years old\"\n[5] \"25-34 years old\" \"35-44 years old\" \"45-54 years old\" \"55-64 years old\"\n\n\nWe use the level() function, and we inform R which columns we want to look at inside the parentheses. We obtain the results as above.\nThere are 8 groups, but the first one corresponds to people who did not reply. We would like to remove this in order to have a full dataset. If we do not want to do it with other libraries, we can do it as follows:\n\ndata2 &lt;- subset(data2, What.is.your.age. != \"\")\n\ndata2$What.is.your.age. &lt;- droplevels(data2$What.is.your.age.)\n\n\nIn the first line, we are telling R to remove the rows where the group is ““.\n\nTo do so, we use the subset() function. In the parentheses, we set the parameters to tell R which rows to remove: dataset name (“data2”), column (“What.is.your.age.”), level (““).\nNote that we used the sign “!=”. This sign means “remove”. If we change this sign to “==”, it means “select”!\n\nWe only removed the rows corresponding to ““, but not the label. This is the purpose of the second line.\n\nNow you can run the “levels(data2$What.is.your.age.)” again. You will see that the level “” has indeed been removed!\n\nlevels(data2$What.is.your.age.)\n\n[1] \"&lt;18 years old\"   \"&gt;65 years old\"   \"18-24 years old\" \"25-34 years old\"\n[5] \"35-44 years old\" \"45-54 years old\" \"55-64 years old\"\n\n\nIf we look at the column called “How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.”, there is the same problem. We just have to run the same codes to solve this!\n\ndata2 &lt;- subset(data2, How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. != \"\")\n\ndata2$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. &lt;- droplevels(data2$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.)\n\nNow we would like to summarize the number of observations per group. And I will have to make an exception to what I said earlier: We are using the package called “dplyr”. So you will need to download it beforehand.\nHere is the code you need to write:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata3 &lt;- data2 %&gt;% \n  group_by(What.is.your.age., How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.) %&gt;% \n  summarize(Count = n())\n\nLet’s decompose this:\n\nIn the first line, we just loaded the library we need.\nThe sign “%&gt;%” is here to say we are going to run the codes below it based on the dataset called “data2”\nThe “group_by()” function is here to tell R which columns we will take into consideration. Notice that we do not need to write “data2$What.is.your.age.” since we used the “%&gt;%” sign.\nFinally, the last line of code is the transformation we are performing: We want to summarize the data. Inside the “summarize()” function, we need to give the details of what we want to do (notice that you can also write “summarise()”!).\n\nThe “n()” function means that we just want to count the number of observations per group,\nAnd the observations will be found in the “Count” column. Note that you can replace “Count” by any name you want!\n\nAnd finally, we store this summary table into a new variable, which we call “data3”.\n\nYou should obtain something like this in the picture below:\n\n\n\nThere are of course many more ways to transform the data, summarize them, etc. This subsection was only a snapshot of what is possible to do with a very minimum number of lines of codes!\n\n\n3.2.7 Plotting the data\nNow that we have summarized data, we can plot to see what they look like. We will use a very straightforward function, called… “plot()”! Let’s see what it does with the codes below.\n\nplot(x = data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(x = data3$What.is.your.age., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe ran into a minor problem: R sorted the groups in alphabetical order, which is not quite straightforward! So we will need to reorder the levels first. Let’s do it with the code below:\n\ndata3$What.is.your.age. &lt;- factor(data3$What.is.your.age., levels = c(\"&lt;18 years old\",\n    \"18-24 years old\",\n    \"25-34 years old\",\n    \"35-44 years old\",\n    \"45-54 years old\",\n    \"55-64 years old\",\n    \"&gt;65 years old\"))\n\ndata3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day. &lt;- factor(data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., levels = c(\"Less than 1\",\n         \"1\",\n         \"2\",\n         \"3\",\n         \"4\",\n         \"More than 4\"))\n\nYou can check whether this worked by using the “levels()” function we introduced above.\n\nlevels(data3$What.is.your.age.)\n\n[1] \"&lt;18 years old\"   \"18-24 years old\" \"25-34 years old\" \"35-44 years old\"\n[5] \"45-54 years old\" \"55-64 years old\" \"&gt;65 years old\"  \n\n\n\nlevels(data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day.)\n\n[1] \"Less than 1\" \"1\"           \"2\"           \"3\"           \"4\"          \n[6] \"More than 4\"\n\n\nEverything is in the order we want, now we can plot one more time, You will obtain the plots as below!\n\nplot(x = data3$What.is.your.age., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(x = data3$How.many.cups.of.coffee.do.you.typically.drink.per.day., y = data3$Count)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first plot shows that most of the participants are between 25 and 34 years old. The second plot indicates that most of the respondents drink between 1 and 2 cups of coffee everyday.\nYou might be curious whether there is an interaction, with older people drinking more coffee than younger people. In other words, you would need three variables in the codes… which is very difficult to do without other packages, espectially the “ggplot2” one! You can try by yourself!\n\n\n3.2.8 Save data from R to your computer\nFor some reason, we may want to save our data in the computer. But we are actually referring to two things at the same time:\n\nSaving the R dataset, and\nExporting the R dataset such that we can open it with other programs.\n\nBoth are doable, and let’s start with the first option with the code below.\n\nsave(data3, file = \"data3.Rdata\")\n\nWe just need the “save()” function, inside which we first tell R the dataset we want to save, and then the name of the file on the computer. We can choose the name of the file by ourself, as long as we do not forget the “.Rdata” extension. Once it is save, we can load the file later using the “load()” function.\n\nload(file = \"data3.Rdata\")\n\nWe may also want to save the data as a .csv file, readable by programs such as Excel. This is done with the code below:\n\nwrite.csv(data3, \"data3.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nLet’s unpack it:\n\nWe use the “write.csv” function, and we provide details inside the parentheses for:\n\nThe name of the dataset we want to export (here, data3),\nThe name we want it to have in our computer (here, data3.csv), and\nthe “row.names = FALSE” is here to say that we do not want the index of the rows. You can try and change to “TRUE” to see what happens.\n\n\nIt is also possible to export to .xlsx files, more directly readable by Excel, but this requires another library. We will encounter this in the rest of the tutorial.\n\n\n3.2.9 R script of this section\nYou can find the R scripts including the codes presented in this section here. Don’t hesitate to use it and add comments for each line of code to make your own!",

    "text": "So far, we have been talking about something called “R/RStudio”. People familiar with this program know what this is about.

This is where all the magic happens. RStudio is a user-friendly interface such that it is easier to work with.\nMaybe a metaphor can help to understand the difference between R and RStudio. As you are engaging yourself in this tutorial, I assume that you have a computer (and that you are using one). You can create folders, open Word or Excel documents, write in it and save them in the folders you created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nNow it is time to reflect on what you are doing. You have done these tasks by using your mouse or your touchpad and clicking on icons (or figures) on your screen. What you may not know is that when doing so, you have run many lines of codes. Actually, it is your computer that ran them in programs able to perform computations. Your role has been to trigger these programs by using the user-friendly interface installed in your computer.\n\n\nThis is the exact same thing with R and RStudio. R will perform the computations that you ask for. And you will ask R to do stuff by clicking on icons and writing commands using the user-friendly interface of RStudio. And this is why you need to download two programs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnecdote\n\n\n\nLet me share a personal anecdote when I just entered graduate school and I had my very first class of language programming for linguistic research. Just before leaving, the instructor said very quickly that we had to, I quote, “download R for next time”. I had never heard of R, and to me, calling a program with only one letter seemed kind of awkward. Therefore, I assumed that I misheard the instructions, or that I missed some information. You can just imagine how surprised I was when I googled “R” and actually found that this existed!",

Even if we have been very careful when writing the scraping code, there are surely unnecessary data we need to remove, format problems, or further annotations to do. The reasons are quite simple: (a) while the majority of the webpages we scraped has a consistent structure, it is possible that some were slightly different, (b) unnecessary parts were coded under the same HTML nodes, such that it was not possible to scrape the data we wanted without scraping them as well, (c) it was easier to write the scraping code that way.\nThat’s why we need to go through the cleaning process before rushing into the analyses! The main problems we will encounter are:\n\nThe format of the table is not suited for analyses, so we need to arrange it\nUnnecessary data need to be removed, otherwise it will affect the results\nSimple annotations can be made, and these will be helpful for both the cleaning and analyses processes",

    "text": "1.2 Some cleaning principles\n\nWe clean, we don’t fish\nThe cleaning process is here such that the data set will be ready for further analyses. But there are two important points we need to keep in mind:\n\nWe might over-clean, meaning that while we removed unnecessary data, we removed much more than what we thought. That’s why we need to check each time that we are not removing too much\nWe might be biased. We have a research question in mind, and maybe some ideas about what the results may look like. Sometimes, we are so engaged in our study that we assume the results before conducting the analyses… and in that case, we may be so biased that we consider counterexamples as errors to remove before the analyses. This is completely wrong, and the cleaning process should be blind!!\n\n\n\nWe must be aware of the final format of the data set\nEspecially in R, the most common format of the data set is “1 row = 1 data point”. A “data point” may be one whole text, one paragraph, one sentence, etc. Then, each column of that row is related to the same data point. In other words, it is not ideal to have the same data point on two different rows! Transforming the data towards that direction is also part of the cleaning process.\nExample of a data set with a suitable format (fake data):\n\n\n\nDate\nArticle\nSentence\n… (other data)\nLink\n\n\n\n\n2024-01-01\nArticle 1\nSentence 1\n…\nLink 1\n\n\n2024-01-01\nArticle 1\nSentence 2\n…\nLink 1\n\n\n2024-01-01\nArticle 1\nSentence 3\n…\nLink 1\n\n\n2024-01-03\nArticle 2\nSentence 1\n…\nLink 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe must be close to our data\nThere are at least two reasons for that:\n\nThe closer you are to your data, the more you know what to do to clean them\nNot all the cleaning steps are necessary, it really depends on your data set!\n\n[Page to be completed later]",

This is called the YAML part. It looks like this so far:\n\n\n\nYou will remark that there are pre-filled information, such as the title of the document, the name(s) of the author(s), the date and the output format. These are what we were prompted to fill when creating the document! Now you can try to change some things, for instance:\n\nTitle: Change to “My first R Markdown script”\nAuthor: Change to you name\nDate: Change to the date you wish, or even delete this line if you do not wish to add a date\n\n\n\n2.1.2 More advanced features of the YAML block\nYou can also add other pieces of information, for instance:\n\nDate:\nYou have more options, such as defining the format of the date, and maybe more interestingly, create a variable such that you do not have to change the date anytime you save the document. In other words, you may want to have a line specifying something like “This document was last modified on ‘Year-Month-Day’”. Just write as follows:\n\n\ndate: \"This document was last modified on `r Sys.Date()`\"\n\nThe code 2025-11-18 will look at the date of the system of your computer.\n\nTable of contents:\nThe addition of titles in the document is here to help when navigating it. You can also add a table of contents such that it is even easier to navigate. You can also specify how many layers you want to display in the table of contents.\n\n\ntoc: true\ntoc-depth: 4 ## Change this value depending on how many layers you wish to display\n\n\nFormat:\nFor now, the output format is “html”. Just replace with other values according to the output format you want (for example: “pdf_document”).\n\nIn the end, the YAML block should look like this:\n\n    ---\n    title: \"My first R Markdown script\"\n    author: \"Your name\"\n    date: \"This document was last modified on `r Sys.Date()`\"\n    output: pdf_document\n    toc: yes\n    toc-depth: 4\n    ---",

Please note that they are optional: It is possible to write a whole R Markdown document without any title! But as the code gets longer, it can easily become messy to the point that it is very difficult to understand what we are doing. In other words, the titles and subparts are here to clarify everything!\nAdding titles and subparts is very simple. You just need to click on the button where the header options can be found. For example, if you want to write the title of a main part (let’s say, “1. Introduction”), you click on “Header 1”, and you write the name of the title. It is the same process for subtitles. Let’s say you want a subpart called “1.1 Introduction within the introduction”, you just click on “Header 2” and you write what you want for the subtitle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI personally prefer when the structure is numbered, this is why I add the number of the sections like “1. Introduction”, or “1.1 Introduction of the introduction”. But this is not obligatory and depends on your style!\n\n\nThe titles and subparts are also very important to set the table of contents!",

Everything you write in an R Script is considered as a code, unless you use the hashtag signs to tell R that this is a comment. In other words, everything that you write in the document is considered as a comment, so do not hesitate to write as much as you want as long as it makes things clearer for you!\n\n\n2.3.2 Writing the code\nIf what we write inside the document is not considered as a code, then how to add one?\nYou Just need to click on “Insert”, then “Code Chunk”, and finally “R”. Normally, a grey code block will appear with {r} at the top line to indicate that this is an R code block. Everything written in this grey block will be considered as R code. You can also add comments inside the block using hashtags as you can do in a typical R Script. Sometimes, R will display simple messages and/or warnings at the same time as you run the code. It is possible to “hide” them, you just need to add the following lines below {r}, as below.\nYour code chunk will look like this:\n\n\n\nFinally, you can run the code chunk without running ALL the document.

    "text": "2.3 More about the structure of the website\nWe are clear about the task now: We want to get the data from classic Chinese books. We could start with the original link of the website, and try to find the link to the webpage by parsing the pages one by one. But sometimes, it is just easier to go manually, so we will directly start from the page listing all the classic Chinese books: https://millionbook.net/gd/gdxs.html.\nThe real game begins: How to find the links to the webpages of the individual books? We know from our manual check in the previous section that we cannot really guess the links. So we have no choice but to look at the structure of the website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you remember how to access the structure of the website?\n\n\n\nThis is the same step as in Weeks 6 and 7 described here.\n\n\nOnce you accessed the structure of the webpage, it is time to play hide and seek and look for one book, let’s sat the first one: 紅樓夢 (Dream of the Red Chamber). You will find these lines:\n\n&lt;TR&gt;\n  &lt;TD WIDTH=\"33%\" class=\"tt1\"&gt;\n    &lt;A HREF=\"c/caoxueqing/hlm/index.html\" &gt;紅樓夢&lt;/A&gt;(曹雪芹)\n  &lt;/TD&gt;\n\n  &lt;TD WIDTH=\"33%\" class=\"tt1\"&gt;\n    &lt;B&gt;\n      &lt;A HREF=\"l/luoguanzhong/index.html\" &gt;羅貫中文集&lt;/A&gt;\n    &lt;/B&gt;\n  &lt;/TD&gt;\n\n  &lt;TD WIDTH=\"33%\" class=\"tt1\"&gt;\n    &lt;A HREF=\"s/shinaian/shz/index.html\" &gt;水滸傳&lt;/A&gt;(施耐庵)\n  &lt;/TD&gt;\n&lt;/TR&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay attention\n\n\n\nEach website has its own organization, and here you have an example:\n\nSome HTML codes are written in capital letters, but this is not relevant to scrape the data\nThe links to the individual books are shorten, which means that we will have to recreate them\nThe structure is not always consistent, so we need to keep this in mind during the scraping process\n\n\n\nThe most challenging part here is the fact the the links are shorten. If you click on them, you actually obtain something like that:\n\nhttps://millionbook.net/gd/c/caoxueqing/hlm/index.html\n\nThis will be an additional step to add in the code.\n\nAccessing the individual chapters\nLet’s access the first book with the link above. The website looks like that:\n\n\n\nWe have a table with the chapter number on the left grey part, and on the right the title of the chapter with the hyperlink. The structure looks like this:\n\n\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n  &lt;td&gt;第 一 回&nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;td&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"001.htm\" &gt;甄士隱夢幻識通靈&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"001.htm\" &gt;賈雨村風塵怀閨秀&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/td&gt;\n\n  &lt;td&gt;第 二 回&nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;td&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"002.htm\" &gt;賈夫人仙逝揚州城&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"002.htm\" &gt;冷子興演說榮國府&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\nThe &lt;tr&gt; and &lt;td&gt; elements are here to create the table. &lt;br&gt; means “go to the next line”, and this is why the titles of the chapters are on two lines on the website.\nBut you will remark two things when observing the links:\n\nAgain, they are shorten. If you click on them, you actually have something like that: https://millionbook.net/gd/c/caoxueqing/hlm/001.htm. So we know that this is another link we will have to reconstruct. The good news is that this is very predictable.\nThe same links appear two times. This will require extra work when writing the code, but we already encountered the same problem in the past two weeks. So nothing impossible to do!\n\n\n\nAccessing the content of the chapter\nLet’s click on the link to Chapter 1, and let’s have a look at the webpage:\n\nWe have here:\n\nThe title of the chapter in red\nThe text of the chapter in black\nThree links leading to the previous chapter, the next chapter and the table of contents in blue\n\nAgain, let’s look at the structure of the website:\n\n&lt;TD class=\"tt2\" bgcolor=\"#F1F1F3\" width=\"84%\"&gt;\n  &lt;center&gt;\n    &lt;FONT style=\"FONT-SIZE: 12pt\" COLOR=\"#FF5555\"&gt;\n      &lt;B&gt;第一回　甄士隱夢幻識通靈　賈雨村風塵怀閨秀\n      &lt;/B&gt;\n  &lt;/center&gt;\n    &lt;/FONT&gt;\n\n&lt;hr color=\"#EE9B73\" size=\"1\" width=\"94%\"&gt;\n  \n&lt;BR&gt;\n　　此開卷第一回也．作者自云：因曾歷過一番夢幻之后，故將真事隱去，而借\"通靈\"之說，撰此《石頭記》一書也．故曰\"甄士隱\"云云．但書中所記何事何人？自又云：“今風塵碌碌，一事無成，忽念及當日所有之女子，一一細考較去，覺其行止見識，皆出于我之上．何我堂堂須眉，誠不若彼裙釵哉？實愧則有余，悔又無益之大無可如何之日也！當此，則自欲將已往所賴天恩祖德，錦衣紈褲之時，飫甘饜肥之日，背父兄教育之恩，負師友規談之德，以至今日一技無成，半生潦倒之罪，編述一集，以告天下人：我之罪固不免，然閨閣中本自歷歷有人，万不可因我之不肖，自護己短，一并使其泯滅也．雖今日之茅椽蓬牖，瓦灶繩床，其晨夕風露，階柳庭花，亦未有妨我之襟怀筆墨者．雖我未學，下筆無文，又何妨用假語村言，敷演出一段故事來，亦可使閨閣昭傳，复可悅世之目，破人愁悶，不亦宜乎？\"故曰\"賈雨村\"云云．\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n　　此回中凡用“夢”用“幻”等字，是提醒閱者眼目，亦是此書立意本旨．\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n　　列位看官：你道此書從何而來？說起根由雖近荒唐，細按則深有趣味．待在下將此來歷注明，方使閱者了然不惑．\n&lt;/TD&gt;\n\nThere are many things to unpack here:\n\nYou will remark that the text as within a &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt; element, and its “class” is “tt2”\nWithin this element, you have:\n\n&lt;center&gt; and &lt;font&gt; elements (not very well organized), and these correspond to the title in red\nan &lt;hr&gt; element, which correspond to the orange line between the title and the main text\nthe &lt;br&gt; element one more time\nand finally the main text, without specific class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about it\n\n\n\nThe text is therefore directly within the &lt;td&gt; element called “tt2”. So this is the only way to access the text… but the title is also within this element!\nThis means that we have no choice but scraping the title of the chapter as well. This is important to note such details as we will have to handle them when preprocessing the data.",

Based on the code, these elements contain the book titles.\nhtml_text(): Extracts the plain text (the titles) from those elements.\nListBooks[-c(90)]: Removes the 90th item, which the author noted was a blank entry.\nhtml_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;% html_attr(\"href\"): This finds the &lt;a&gt; (link) tags within the “.tt1” elements and extracts their href attribute (the actual URL, e.g., “book_name/index.html”).\nListBooks &lt;- as.data.frame(ListBooks): Converts the list of titles into a data frame.\npaste0(...): Creates full, absolute URLs by combining the base URL (https://millionbook.net/gd/) with the relative URLs (e.g., “book_name/index.html”) extracted earlier.\nstr_detect(...) & subset(...): This is a data cleaning step. The code checks which URLs end in “index.html” (which are assumed to be book-level index pages) and removes any that don’t, ensuring the list only contains valid books to scrape.\n\n\n\nRetrieve the URLs of the chapters of a book\nThis section digs one level deeper. It goes into each book’s index page to find the URLs for all of its chapters.\n\nOne page to test\n\nIndBook &lt;- read_html(ListBooks$ListURL[81])\n\nChapterURL &lt;- IndBook %&gt;%\n  html_nodes(\"td\") %&gt;%\n  html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;%\n  html_attr(\"href\")\n\nChapterURL &lt;- ChapterURL[-c(1, 2, 3)]\nprint(ChapterURL)\nChapterURL &lt;- unique(ChapterURL)\nprint(ChapterURL)\n\n## Reconstruct the full URL\nTempBookURL &lt;- gsub(\"index.html\", \"\", ListBooks$ListURL[81])\nFullChapterURL &lt;- paste0(TempBookURL, ChapterURL)\nprint(FullChapterURL)\n\nThis chunk is a test run on a single book (ListBooks$ListURL[81]) to make sure the logic works before applying it to all books.\n\nread_html(...): Downloads the HTML for one book’s index page.\nhtml_nodes(\"td\") %&gt;% html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;% html_attr(\"href\"): Finds all links (&lt;a&gt;) that are inside table cells (&lt;td&gt;) and gets their URLs. This is how the chapter list is structured on that page.\nChapterURL &lt;- ChapterURL[-c(1, 2, 3)]: Removes the first three links, which are likely navigation links (e.g., “Home,” “Back”) and not chapters.\nunique(ChapterURL): Removes any duplicate chapter links.\ngsub(...) & paste0(...): This reconstructs the full chapter URLs. It takes the book’s URL (e.g., .../book_name/index.html), removes the “index.html” part to get a base directory, and then appends the specific chapter file (e.g., 001.html) to it.\n\n\n\nFind the URLs of the chapters from all the books\n\nURL_BookChapters_total &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 1, nrow = 0))\n\nfor (i in 1:length(ListBooks$ListURL)){\n  IndBook &lt;- read_html(ListBooks$ListURL[i])\n  \n  ChapterURL &lt;- IndBook %&gt;%\n    html_nodes(\"td\") %&gt;%\n    html_nodes(\"a\") %&gt;%\n    html_attr(\"href\")\n  \n  ChapterURL &lt;- ChapterURL[-c(1, 2, 3)]\n  ChapterURL &lt;- unique(ChapterURL)\n  \n  TempBookURL &lt;- gsub(\"index.html\", \"\", ListBooks$ListURL[i])\n  FullChapterURL &lt;- paste0(TempBookURL, ChapterURL)\n  \n  URL_BookChapters &lt;- (data.frame(ChapterURL = FullChapterURL,\n                       Book = ListBooks$ListBooks[i]))\n  \n  URL_BookChapters_total &lt;- rbind(URL_BookChapters_total, URL_BookChapters)\n}\n\n## Remove links to images (.jpg)\n## Check if books finish with \"index.html\"\nURL_BookChapters_total$image &lt;- str_detect(URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL, \".jpg\")\nURL_BookChapters_total$image &lt;- as.factor(URL_BookChapters_total$image)\nURL_BookChapters_total &lt;- droplevels(subset(URL_BookChapters_total, image != TRUE))\nrownames(URL_BookChapters_total) &lt;- NULL\n\nThis part applies the logic from the test (2.2.1) to every book found in section 2.1.\n\nURL_BookChapters_total &lt;- data.frame(...): Creates an empty data frame to store all the chapter URLs from all books.\nfor (i in 1:length(ListBooks$ListURL)): A loop that iterates through each book URL.\nInside the loop, it repeats the exact same logic from 2.2.1 (read page, find links, clean, create full URLs).\nURL_BookChapters &lt;- (data.frame(...)): Creates a small data frame for the current book’s chapters, helpfully including the book’s title.\nrbind(...): Appends this small data frame to the main URL_BookChapters_total data frame.\nPost-loop Cleaning: After the loop finishes, str_detect is used to find and remove any links that mistakenly point to .jpg image files instead of text chapters. The comments note that inconsistent site structure for a few books caused issues, which this cleaning step helps fix.\n\n\n\n\nScrape the content of the chapters\nThis is the final scraping step, where the script visits every single chapter URL and downloads the actual text.\n\nTest with one page\n\nChapter &lt;- data.frame()\n\nj = 3672\n\nOneChapter &lt;- read_html(URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL[j])\n\nChapterContent &lt;- OneChapter %&gt;%\n  html_nodes(\".tt2\") %&gt;%\n  html_text()\n\nChapterTitle &lt;- sub(\"\\r.*\", \"\", ChapterContent)\n\nChapter &lt;- (data.frame(Book = URL_BookChapters_total$Book[j],\n                       Title = ChapterTitle,\n                       Content = ChapterContent,\n                       URL = URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL[j]))\n\nhead(Chapter)\n\nAgain, this is a test on a single chapter (j = 3672) to finalize the logic.\n\nread_html(...): Downloads the HTML for one chapter page.\nhtml_nodes(\".tt2\") %&gt;% html_text(): Selects the HTML element with the class “tt2” (where the main content is stored) and extracts all the text from it.\nsub(\"\\r.*\", \"\", ChapterContent): A clever trick to get the title. It assumes the title is the very first line of the text. This command finds the first carriage return (\\r, a line break) and removes everything after it, leaving just the first line.\ndata.frame(...): Organizes the scraped data (Book, Title, Content, URL) into a data frame.\n\n\n\nScrape all the chapters for all book\n\nBook_total &lt;- data.frame()\n\n\nfor (j in 1:length(URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL)){\n  tryCatch({\n\n    OneChapter &lt;- read_html(URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL[j])\n    \n    ChapterContent &lt;- OneChapter %&gt;%\n      html_nodes(\".tt2\") %&gt;%\n      html_text()\n    \n    ChapterTitle &lt;- sub(\"\\r.*\", \"\", ChapterContent)\n    \n    Chapter &lt;- (data.frame(Book = URL_BookChapters_total$Book[j],\n                           Title = ChapterTitle,\n                           Content = ChapterContent,\n                           URL = URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL[j]))\n    Book_total &lt;- rbind(Book_total, Chapter)\n    \n        # Update the progress \n    percentage_completed &lt;- round(j/length(URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL) * 100, 2)\n    cat(c(\"Process\", j, \"out of\", length(URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL), \"percentage completed:\", percentage_completed, \"%\", \"\\n\"))\n    \n  }, error=function(e){cat(\"ERROR :\",conditionMessage(e), \"\\n\")})\n}\n\nhead(Book_total)\n\nThis loop executes the final scraping.\n\nBook_total &lt;- data.frame(): Creates a new empty data frame to store the final content.\nfor (j in 1:length(URL_BookChapters_total$ChapterURL)): A loop that iterates through every single chapter URL collected in section 2.2.2.\ntryCatch({...}, error=...): This is a very important safety feature. It “tries” to run the scraping code inside {...}. If any error occurs (e.g., a broken link, a network timeout), the error=... function will catch it, print an error message, and continue to the next iteration of the loop. Without this, the entire script would crash on a single bad link.\nInside the tryCatch, it repeats the logic from 2.3.1 (read page, get text, extract title).\nrbind(...): Appends the new chapter’s data to the Book_total data frame.\ncat(...): Prints a progress message to the console so the user can see how far along the script is.",
