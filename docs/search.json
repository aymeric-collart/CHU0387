If you are already familiar with coding and/or the RStudio interface, it will of course be easier for you.\n\n\n2- Which public?\n\nAnyone interested in Formosan languages[1] is welcome to take this tutorial, regardless if you are an undergraduate or graduate student, research assistant or just curious about quantitative methods and Formosan languages.\n\nÂ  ðŸ“° Â   News\n\nNote:\nThe webpage of this tutorial has just been created. Thatâ€™s why it looks quite empty and some pages not at their right place.\nStay tuned for further developments!\n\n\n[1] I use the term â€˜Formosan languagesâ€™ as the Austronesian languages from Taiwan, including Yami (even though from a typological perspective, Yami is not a Formosan language)."

In other words, this tutorial will not discuss the fundamental concepts of corpus linguistics, how to ask a research question and how to motivate it. If you are interested in it, you can read the book published by Anatol Stefanowitsch in 2020, available for free here. This tutorial will also not discuss advanced statistical methods in corpus linguistics, such as classification analyses or vector space representations."

    "text": "2 How to get through the exercises\nThe best (if not only) way to learn how to use programming language is just with practice. There are two ways to do so throughout the tutorial. In either case, I highly recommend to use markdown scripts (to know more about markdown scripts, you can refer to Section 1.3.\n\nI will provide at the beginning of each section a markdown file prefilled with the structure of the section. You can download this file and open it with R, and just paste the codes at the relevant sections of the script.\nAlternatively, you may wish to write the script yourself, and to work based on the codes in each section. This is also a great way to learn how to structure a markdown file alone!"
